Adding to the confusion is the word ‘community college\', which is highly advertised by most education consultants here. So, what are the differences among them? Which one should you attend?\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>College vs University</strong></span>\n\nUniversity and college are institutions that offer higher or tertiary education. This usually begins in the thirteenth year of education after high school. Both university and college offer four-year undergraduate programs (or program sarjana) from which will earn students bachelor degrees (or S1). Americans tend to refer to their undergraduate study in university as ‘college\', but this is just a matter of preference. The phrase ‘going to college\' basically means continuing into tertiary study. So… no differences?\n\nYes there are. Schools that call themselves ‘university\' usually also offer graduate and/or post-graduate programs (or program pascasarjana), where students pursue graduate and doctoral degrees (or S2/S3) on top of a bachelor\'s degree; However, colleges do not. This means that a college may also be part of a university. For example, Harvard College houses all undergraduate programs for Harvard University. Both university and college have faculties or schools based on majors. Colleges offer a rather specific courses, while universities usually are larger and offer a wider options of courses.\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Community College</span></strong>\n\nCommunity college offers two-year degree program – a lower level of tertiary study. Students will obtain their associate\'s degree here. Those who plan to pursue a bachelor\'s degree MUST transfer from a community college to a college or university by the end of the two-year program, i.e. the ‘2+2\' route.\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Community College Route</span></strong>\n\nOne benefit of attending a community college is the cost. Four-year schools cost easily 3-5 times more than community colleges (especially for international students), according to a 2014 study by the College Board. While saving some money, students are able to take time to figure out what they really wanted to study and why. This is possible given the notion of the American education system that allows students to declare their majors only by the end of sophomore year (or year 2).\n\nCommunity colleges also give students a second chance to improve their grades or eligibility for admission to desired universities. Plus, community college students may enjoy smaller class size (~25-35 students); large universities tend to have &gt;100 students for their introductory courses. This route is also best fitted to those who look to learning more technical and practical skills and if the career they want to pursue does not require a bachelor\'s degree.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that there is a lack of ‘campus life\' and university experiences due to limited campus facilities, student clubs, and athletic programs in community colleges. Students need to make sure to take the right courses and stay in close contact with their transfer adviser.\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Direct College or University Route</span></strong>\n\nIt is a good place to start for those who already know what they want to study or where they want to go. Applying straight to your dream school could be your best bet to get in. This is because there are not many slots available in that particular university or college unless a lot of students transfer out from them. The number of accepted transfer students also varies from one school to another and year by year. It is unpredictable.\n\nHeading straight to a four-year school also provides many social opportunities – housing, on-campus jobs, and wide array of student organizations. Students are able to make connections that can be beneficial post-college.\n\nNow, should you attend a college or a university? Both of them are basically equal academically. It all depends on what field you are interested in as some institutions might be more specialized in that particular field than others. For example, if you are more interested in doing research, university tends to have better focus on researches as they are generally larger and thus receive higher overall funding.\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Go with What\'s Best for You</span></strong>\n\nIn the end, nothing is more important than getting into the school where you can maximize your learning potential and pursue your interests. This depends on your characters and personalities, aspirations, learning styles, and expectations of college experience in general. It is best to not only research your options, but also discuss with existing students or alumni from the universities of your choice. Consultation with the right admission advisor would also help you save a lot of time from getting lost in the information, to narrow down your choices, and to find your best-fit school.<!--more--><!--more-->', 'uni.jpg', 'What’s the difference between a university, college, and community college?', 'publish', '', 'university', 'What’s the difference between a university, college, and community college?', 'en', 0, '', 'false', '2016-05-22 17:00:00', '2016-04-30 17:00:00', '2022-11-06 17:00:00'),

As the long June holiday is approaching, what plans do you have in mind? Traveling? Volunteering? Exploring new hobbies? Whatever it is, I hope you have something more exciting planned than turning into a couch potato or being absorbed into your smartphone.\n\n<strong>If you are a rising senior (going into Grade 12 / Year 13)…&nbsp; </strong>\n\nYou might want to start gearing up towards the <strong>application season</strong>. This includes finalizing your college list, making note of all application deadlines, drafting your resume, and thinking about the college essay prompts. You can also arrange college visits to convince yourself on where to apply. Otherwise, talking to alumni or existing students from colleges in your list will help too. These days, social media make networking even easier than ever. This is important as <strong>starting early</strong> could work wonders and be a game changer for your college applications. Nevertheless, your penultimate high school summer holiday doesn\'t have to be stressful. All these can be done while you\'re on a beach, for example. After all, you\'ve worked hard the entire school year, and you deserve to unwind.\n\n<strong>If you are a rising junior (going into Grade 11 / Year 12)…</strong>\n\nYou should find productive activities that <strong>reinforce your core interests and goals</strong>. If you\'re into animal kingdom, for example, try checking out volunteering / research programs at <a href=\"http://www.cikanangawildlifecenter.com/?page_id=40\">Cikananga Wildlife Center</a> in the southern of Sukabumi. You can also be imaginative and start a charity project for social causes you\'re most concerned with, e.g. gather teens to collect trash on our beautiful beaches could increase community awareness and help Jokowi with his ‘<a href=\"http://revolusimental.go.id/\">revolusi mental</a>\' mission. Whatever you do, make sure that you\'re passionate about it and it is an extension of your personal interests.\n\nIn addition to extracurricular activities, keep in mind that you should <strong>start preparing for the standardized tests</strong>, i.e. TOEFL/IELTS and SAT/ACT. It will be good to try-out those tests and see which one fits your abilities best, after which you can devise a study plan that works for you.\n\n<strong>If you are a rising sophomore (going into Grade 10 / Year 11)…</strong>\n\nYou have quite a bit of time to prepare for your college applications. Therefore, spend your holiday with <strong>activities that will engage you</strong>. You can enroll in a study abroad program or take summer classes at a college of your dreams. This is good to give you an idea about how the pool of applicants looks like. More importantly, you get to experience the campus life at your dream school, understand the opportunities they offer, and make connections with existing students and faculty members.\n\nOther than that, you can also explore getting <strong>a paid or unpaid internship</strong> at local startups. Ask your brothers or sisters or uncles if they know some companies that will hire high school students for a summer internship (<a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/index.php/careers/\">we do</a>!). Or, you can just call or email them yourself. Train your networking skills and be creative! The whole experience will give you a taste of not only how real startup works, but also how real world operates. In addition, don\'t be shy to create your own business if you have an awesome idea. Finally, you can <strong>write a blog</strong> about all your invaluable experiences and create an online presence. This is an asset for you to showcase your passions, potentials, and personalities to admission officers. Maintain the blog and you will have a great online presence by the time you complete your college applications two years from now.\n\n<strong>Have a great summer! </strong>', '2ea5db6a-993c-4b84-95dd-f0c9cd9ab102.jpg', 'High-schooler, what are you doing this summer?', 'publish', 'High-schooler, what are you doing this summer?', 'high schooler', 'You should find productive activities that reinforce your core interests and goals', 'en', 0, '', 'false', '2016-05-30 17:00:00', '2016-05-09 17:00:00', '2022-12-07 17:00:00'),

Make an informed decision by knowing who you are, what areas you are comfortable with, and how you can showcase your aptitude.\n\nThe SAT is famous for its killer ‘SAT vocab\' – highly sophisticated words that are rarely used in daily life. The ACT, on the other hand, is well known for its strict time constraint. Both tests undergo revisions from time to time, with the latest overhaul done by the College Board (the SAT test maker). The redesigned SAT was first administered in March 2016; 10 years after the previous revision occurred in 2005.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Overall, the new SAT has now become more similar to the ACT in terms of structure and focus. The overhaul of the SAT also results in fewer questions and removed guessing penalty. Like the ACT, the new SAT also treats essay as optional! &nbsp;Read on for more details.</p>\n\n<ol>\n 	<li>Goodbye killer ‘SAT vocab\'!</li>\n</ol>\nThe SAT has claimed to move into incorporating vocab that will be useful throughout your life, i.e. “vocab you\'ll use long after test day”. The College Board took similar approach as the ACT. Great vocab bank will still be proven useful, but trying to remember 1,000 SAT words no longer makes sense. Allocate your prep time to other aspects of the test.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>SAT questions are ‘trickier\' than ACT questions</li>\n</ol>\nThe SAT focuses on reasoning skills and specific details. It requires you to dissect and analyze the questions in depth. The new SAT reading added evidence questions, which ask you to indicate which part of the passage supports your answer to the previous question. On the other hand, ACT questions tend to be more straightforward. It tests what you already learned from high school. It focuses on how well you study and how you perform under pressure. With one minute per question in the math section and less than one minute in the reading and science sections, it is either you know the answer, or you don\'t.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li>The ACT has a science section</li>\n</ol>\nIf you\'re worried about this section, you will soon realize that you do not need to have scored A in Chemistry, Physics, Biology, etc., to answer the questions successfully. It actually has no theoretical questions that require prior knowledge of any science subject. In fact, it is similar to science passages you find in the new SAT. You just need to look past through the jargon, and apply some common sense in drawing connections between the question and the answer.\n<h4><strong><u>Now, for Indonesian students or students studying in Indonesia… </u></strong></h4>\nIndonesian curriculum tends to be more focused on English grammars than vocabularies, and have relatively strong math foundation. Since the ACT is also more focused on math, Indonesian students may be better off taking the ACT than the SAT. With straight forward questions, the time pressure of the ACT may not be a problem for us.\n\nWhile there is no more killer ‘SAT vocabs\' section, the new SAT introduced evidence-based reading and writing questions which require students to analyze techniques that an author uses to persuade the audience. The writing section is different from the old SAT in which students present their position on an issue. These aspects require a great reading comprehension ability, which could be lacking in Indonesian students who are non-native English speakers and who do not read regularly. It is not impossible to ace the test, but one should learn how to approach the ‘tricky\' questions in the SAT. In addition, the SAT has just been introduced few months ago, which means limited resources available for your preparation.\n<h4><strong><u>The moment of decision: which one to take</u></strong></h4>\nTake BOTH practice tests to get the general feel of the two tests and to know what to expect. Look at your scores and see which one you did better on. Don\'t forget to analyze your strengths and weaknesses. Is it the time pressure? Or the complexity of the questions asked? If both scores are pretty much on par, pick the one you are more confident doing.\n\nOne thing to remember: schools do NOT prefer one score to the other. So, your main goal is to achieve YOUR highest score in either. Decide early so that you can strategically prepare for a particular test, as each has unique features that must be approached differently when preparing. Remember, <strong>it\'s all in the preparation</strong>.\n\nP.S.

(1229, 'us-college-admission-early-decision-vs-early-action', 1, 0, 'US College Admission: Early Decision vs Early Action', '<h3>For universities in the US, there are basically two types of application for admission: regular or early. Regular decision (RD) is when you submit your admission application on the regular application deadline which is normally in January. There are two types of early applications: early decision (ED) and early action (EA). Both ED and EA applications\' due dates are usually in November, which is much earlier than the RD. Early application deadline is early November (1st or 15th) for most universities that do accept early applications. Accordingly, decision notifications from the university will be received by ED and EA students usually around mid-December, while RD students will get them in early April.</h3>\n<h2>Early Decision vs Early Action</h2>\nEarly decision is a binding agreement, which means that if students apply and get accepted through the ED application, they must attend the college and withdraw all other applications. Students can only apply ED to one university (which is typically their top choice college), and RD to the others. When you receive your ED decision, the school will simultaneously send the letter of acceptance (or rejection) together with their offer of financial aid (if you applied for any).\n\nEarly action, on the other hand, is not a binding agreement. It lets you apply early and get the decision early, plus submit your reply (whether you will be attending) on May 1st, which is the general candidates\' reply date. Unlike ED, you can apply EA to a few other colleges. You can also compare financial aids from other colleges, and wait around for replies from other universities before you have to make your final school choice.\n<h2>Why apply early?</h2>\nBoth early decision (ED) and early action (EA) are beneficial for students who have their higher education plan mapped out clearly, i.e. which exact institution they want to go to, or if they have had a clear list of priorities for the institutions they wish to attend. Applying early not only allow you to have a peace of mind as it reduces stress, but also allow you to unconsciously prepare and plan ahead and better for your college applications. ED also tends to have higher acceptance rates than RD. It also give you more time to look for housing and prepare for your college move, and if you are rejected, you get to reassess options.\n<h2>The potential outcomes</h2>\nEarly decision applications may have three possible outcomes: acceptance, denial, and deferral. Early action and regular decision applications only have two possible outcomes: acceptance and denial.\n<h2>The drawbacks</h2>\nOkay, so is applying early good for every applicants? Well, the answer is that may not be the case for every one. As mentioned before, it will be beneficial ONLY if you know exactly where you want to go, and if you are pretty confident with your application materials as a whole. If you feel that your application package still needs more buffing, you might just consider to apply by regular decision. Applying early also put more pressures on the students to decide early on, especially when they have to commit to one college. Not a drawback but definitely worth noting as part of your application strategy would be that ED decision date is just around two weeks apart from RD application deadlines. So, make sure you have all your applications ready to be submitted while waiting for the ED outcome.\n<h2>In short, ED and EA applications are recommended for students who:</h2>\n<ol>\n 	<li>has done extensive research on colleges and is sure that the college is his/her first choice and the best good fit (academically, socially, geographically, financially)</li>\n 	<li>is confident and well-prepared with his/her application package</li>\n 	<li>do not solely rely on financial aids to study in the university (i.e. ED students will not be able to compare financial aids from other colleges)</li>\n</ol>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Our final advice on early applications</h2>\nNot all colleges have ED, EA, or any early application arrangements, so make sure you check with the universities you will be applying to. Some colleges also offer a nonbinding option of single-choice early action, in which applicants can only apply to one school through an early admission program, but applicants can reply by the regular May 1st deadline. Some institutions such as Harvard, Yale, and Stanford offer this Restrictive Early Action.  If you are ultimately and absolutely sure of your first-choice college, you have found your best-fit college, you are a strong admission candidate for the school, and you can afford the tuition, by all means, apply ED. If you are still not sure of which application plan to go with, one of our education consultants will be able to help you further break them down, and create a personalized admission plan for you.', 'IMG-20160514-WA0018-e1472963421175.jpg', 'US College Admission: Early Decision vs Early Action', 'publish', '', 'early action', 'Early decision is a binding agreement, which means that if students apply and get accepted through the ED application', 'en', 0, '', 'false', '2016-10-04 17:00:00', '2016-09-08 17:00:00', '2022-11-06 17:00:00'),

It is not uncommon&nbsp;for senior year students to feel overwhelmed, trying to juggle their academic loads, extracurricular activities, preparations&nbsp;for college admissions, and at the same time still trying to enjoy the precious final year before everyone goes their own&nbsp;ways! The truth is, even though it\'s going to be busier than your junior years, it should not be that taxing and should not cost you your health and well-being! Here are a few tips to avoid stressing out in your senior year:\n<h4>Start <strong>EARLY</strong></h4>\nWe believe that starting your preparations early, will make you stress less and have a more balanced senior year, especially for those who plan to study abroad, apply for scholarship, etc. Jot down your thoughts, keep a story-board or diary, which might be useful for you later on when&nbsp;brainstorming for your personal essays. You need to realize some components of your college application such as leadership experiences and communicating your passion are not something that you can discover in a short time. They are rather things that you need to cultivate and discover over times. So, start maximizing your high school experiences early—explore and join the school clubs and social activities as a way of life and self-discovery. Do not think of joining an extracurricular activity just as a way to boost your resume. It is beyond that.\n<h4>Avoid senioritis—at all cost</h4>\nSenioritis is&nbsp;when students nearing end of their high school year starts to have lax&nbsp;motivations toward studies. Signs and symptoms of senioritis include missing classes, &nbsp;tardiness, and lower grades. This could seriously hurt your admission chances and cause unnecessary stress at the end. Students should try their best to maintain their drive and academic performances.\n<h4>Get organize—be realistic</h4>\nWhat happens most of the time is we have the tendency to over organize and end up overwhelming ourselves with all the studying and university application processes. Try to get well organized without being over organized. Gather all the information about the majors and the universities that interest you, find out their admission&nbsp;requirements, and how competitive the admission is. Note them down, file them, make sure you can find them easily. Find out and mark all the important dates--such as dates of early action application, regular application, etc. Make a plan. Give yourself REALISTIC deadlines and to-do list. Have an application material checklist ready for every university that you are applying to. Organize those materials that you think will be helpful for when&nbsp;you need to obtain&nbsp;recommendation letters from your teachers. Have them ready, set a date and reminder.\n<h4>Prioritize</h4>\nLearn how to prioritize. It may be tough when you have to tackle school assignments, projects, extracurricular activities, and&nbsp;university preparations all at once. Knowing exactly the things that NEED to be done is the first step. Second, you need to put an order to all these things, based on its importance, urgency, and of course estimated effort required. Third, execute your plan, stay focused, and don\'t procrastinate. However, know that sometimes your priorities may&nbsp;change, and that life is full of uncertainties. When this happens, be flexible and adaptable.\n<h4>Schedule in some personal downtime—RESET</h4>\nDon\'t forget to make sure you also assign yourself some downtime. Embrace your time off by hanging out&nbsp;with your family&nbsp;and friends (and pets), revisiting that&nbsp;personal project you have been putting off, or watching your favorite TV shows. Everybody needs time to relax and reset every now and then, to make sure you can maintain your focus on your goals without getting burnt out!\n<h4>Get the right&nbsp;<strong>SUPPORT</strong></h4>\nIn this modern era, facilitated by technologies, getting support or assistance&nbsp;is easier than ever. You should know that it\'s okay&nbsp;to reach out and seek helps when needed. No one should fight any battles on his or her own. If you feel like you hit a road block, seek for help. It&nbsp;might come from friends, family members, your school teachers and advisors, or expert\'s guidance, especially when it comes to tackling academic hurdles, planning for and applying to universities. Nothing beats getting the right help at the right time. At ALL-in Eduspace, that is one thing that we love to do, we work hand-in-hand with you to get you to where you want to be.

If you ask your parents or your teachers, they might have owned one of the Nokia phones at least at some point in their lives. Nokia was booming in 1990s and 2000s; it was one of the featured phones giants. By 2003, Nokia has sold more than 250 million mobile phones. However, Nokia\'s market shares plummeted year by year since smartphone makers penetrated the market. Their CEO said that they did not do anything wrong.\n\nWhat happened then? The fall of the featured phone giant Nokia was precisely caused by their \'not doing anything wrong\'. Nokia did not innovate fast enough; they were too slow to respond to changes. They were too ignorant to see shifts in consumer demands. Smartphone makers like Blackberry and Apple saw it coming, prepared carefully, and launched their products timely. Boom! Once a leader that <em>drives </em>the market, Nokia has since become a follower that <em>react</em> to the market.\n\nHow about Gojek and Uber? Ten years ago, no one would have thought that we can order a taxi through few clicks on a mobile phone application – quick and easy. Now you can track your ride, estimate the fares, report any issues, all just with the apps. Who would have thought that mobile phones and internet connectivity will be such an integral part of our daily lives? These companies analyze current consumer trends and behaviors, project future needs, and devise products that address market demands. Just like the smartphone makers, they were ahead in their game, seizing opportunities in timely manner.\n\nThe common theme here is that you must think forward, plan well, and act fast to succeed.\n\nThe same logic applies in your education journey. While it is good to do yourself a great favour by choosing a college major that interests you at the <span style=\"font-style: normal !msorm;\"><em>present</em></span>, you should also care about your <span style=\"font-style: normal !msorm;\"><em>future</em></span> by thinking critically about what skill sets will be required in the workforce five to ten years down the road, i.e. when you graduate. Stay ahead of your game. The purpose of education is to gain knowledge and skills to equip us well to seize opportunities and face challenges in the future, to stay competitive especially in the era of globalization and automation, and to contribute to the society through innovations.\n\nSo, remember – broaden your horizon as you choose your college major. To get you started, the following are some of the top majors (from Princeton Review) based on popularity and study&nbsp;on alumni job and salaries. These majors may not guarantee jobs in the future, but for sure will challenge you intellectually.\n<ol>\n 	<li>Computer Science</li>\n 	<li>Communication</li>\n 	<li>Government</li>\n 	<li>Business</li>\n 	<li>Economics</li>\n</ol>\nComputer Science is in the top position. It does not only teach about computer-hardware and software, but also about the various APPLICATIONS of such knowledge, including how technology fits into the business scenario in the present and in the future. Android developer, for example, is a role that did not exist in the past, but now it is advertised everywhere because there is a shortage of mobile application developers globally.&nbsp;The rapidly evolving technology and market requirements propel the needs of more and more software developers. Computer Science graduates are now in huge demands.\n\nWith technology advancements, it is not surprising that communication comes second on the list. Today, communication skills are important not only in journalism but every other industry. The proliferation of digital and social media have created the demand for communication major graduates.\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: normal !msorm;\"><strong>Era of Globalization and Entrepreneurship</strong></span></h3>\nThere are also constant demands for graduates with government, business, and economics degrees. With our society comprise of small, medium, and big enterprises, there is no doubt that people with proven leadership and management qualities are highly sought after.\n\nThe&nbsp;era of globalization&nbsp;creates more competitions and challenges but also offer more opportunities. The demand for progress in various fields put pressure on the present. All these are happening fast. Innovation has become a necessity in our daily lives.\n<h3><strong>Era of Automation</strong></h3>\nAs technologies advance, humans are gradually getting challenged by robots; even now you may have noticed that what used to be done by manual labor is now automated by systems or machines. It is essential to gain skills that will be indispensable in the future and irreplaceable by automation; such as research and innovations, troubleshooting, and process improvements.\n<h3><strong><em>Which major?</em></strong></h3>\nWhether one major will be more important or less relevant than the other in five to ten years is for you to decide.\n\nIt is important to plan your higher education well and carefully, as it may affect your career in the future.&nbsp;The key is to think broad and forward.

Yes! He was THE famous theoretical physicist. He introduced the special theory of relativity, discovered the famous equation: e = mc<sup>2. </sup>He also held an instrumental role in the development of atomic bomb during the World War II. E = mc<sup>2 </sup>means that a small amount of matter can release a large amount of energy. The principle of this equation was later applied in&nbsp;the development of the atomic bomb.\n\nOne of the atomic bombs that materialized during World War II was the “Little Boy,” which was dropped by the U.S. on Hiroshima, Japan. There were 150,000 casualties estimated. It was only 3 m in height and 71 cm in diameter, but had a blast yield of approximately 63 TJ (that\'s terajoule if you\'re wondering what TJ is), which is equivalent to 15 kilotons of TNT!! This is one concrete example of the e = mc<sup>2</sup> principle.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>“<em>It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity\"</em>– Albert Einstein</h2>\nWhat does his quote actually mean at that time? One thing for sure, he was referring technology to the atomic bombs dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The fact that his discovery, which was supposed to be used to help people, was used to materialize weapons of mass destruction, was devastating for him. Einstein may have said what he said for two possible purposes. The first possibility being he could just be venting his anger and disappointment, seeing how technology has turn its back on humanity through pure destruction. Second, it is possible that he wanted to warn the people at the time, as well as those in the younger generation, about the danger of technology if we are not well equipped to handle it.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>It\'s a face-paced world now</h2>\nIn this 21st century, advancement in technologies is&nbsp;more evident&nbsp;than ever.&nbsp;It is moving faster than we can comprehend. Examples are smartphones, internet, social media platforms, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, etc. These technologies have, somewhat, become a necessity to us. They help with all range of work that we used to do manually. They help from the simplest task like cleaning the floor (robot vacuum) to the most complicated ones like manufacturing cars (automated assembly line). Consequently, thanks to technologies, we can get things done much faster,&nbsp;and now we are living in a fast-paced world.\n\nIn this kind of world, the lifestyle, culture, workplace, economy, and even politic will continuously change.&nbsp;The rate of change due to technology is moving at an exponential rate.&nbsp;<strong>This means that the pace approximately doubles every two years.</strong> The pace of technological changes in the 21<sup>st</sup> century is moving forward very rapidly. There lies a possibility where there will be no differences between human and technology in years to come. This will be when&nbsp;Einstein\'s quote has come true in our time. However, this is not inevitable. We can change the way we think. Instead of letting our guards down on technology and let this difference to get closer together, we need to be <strong>alert. </strong>We need to&nbsp;start thinking of <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/index.php/programs/enrichment-programs/\">improving ourselves</a> so that we can become adaptable to the fast-changing technology.\n<h2>The beginning of 21st century skills</h2>\nNow the question is how do we do that?

From our parents, teachers to our friends, we have been bombarded by these types of questions: “what is your dream?”, “where do you see yourself in five years?”, “what do you want to achieve this year?” and so many other similar questions. Many people will even give us “short talks” about the importance of having goals and how we should start setting goals. Even as an adult, you will still hear about it a lot. Unsurprisingly, all their “short talks” are true! That is why so many people keep talking and suggesting it to other people. Setting goals does the trick since it helps steering you from getting off track. You may be confused or are not sure how to start but you won\'t be if you pay attention to these 5 things:\n<ol>\n 	<li><strong>Know the why behind your goals</strong></li>\n</ol>\nDo not just set your goals blindly without knowing the reason. Know the motivation behind them so when difficulties and challenges come (they will), you will not get discouraged and give up. Instead, you will keep moving forward relentlessly because your mind is set on the true reason of striving to achieve those targets in the first place.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li><strong>Break down your goals and make them specific and measurable</strong></li>\n</ol>\nSome people make mistakes by setting a goal that is difficult to measure, such as I want to get a high score or I want to get better. Instead, break them down into several small specific and measurable targets. This method allows you to achieve milestones that will keep you motivated and let you track your progress. Additionally, reviewing your progress gives you opportunities to make appropriate adjustments along the way.\n\nFor instance, you set reading more books as one of your new year\'s resolutions. Break this goal into several small specific todos that you can measure. Reading 24 books in a year can be broken down into a smaller target of reading 2 books per month. Break it down again into reading 2 chapters every single day. In the process, you may find that you read quite fast and end up reading 4 chapters each day. You can then adjust your goals accordingly, such as increasing the number of books read each month to 4.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li><strong>Learn from your past failures and successes</strong></li>\n</ol>\nThe purpose of setting goals is to get better and to improve. Hence, you would want to reflect on the past few years and learn from your past failures and successes. Figure out what mistakes you did that led to those failures. Think of how you can learn from them and what you can do differently. Additionally, learn from your successes. Ask yourself about what you have done to attain such achievements. Keep or improve that thing and make it a habit.\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li><strong>Go crazy but not too crazy</strong></li>\n</ol>\nYou may think that you want to start small and easy with your goals, thinking that they are easier to achieve. This mindset, however, is not doing you any good. It will make you settle for accomplishments that are well within your reach. Instead, go crazy with your goals. Dream big and let it challenges you to unleash your full potential. On the other hand, do not go too crazy either. Be realistic and consider your circumstances, resources and the time frame you have in achieving those aims.\n<ol start=\"5\">\n 	<li><strong>Write it down</strong></li>\n</ol>\nWrite your goals down to make it real to you and as a commitment to yourself. Also, put it in a visible spot so you can read those targets occasionally, to keep you motivated and stay focused to pursue them.\n\nNow, setting goals does not sound hard at all, does it ;)? So, dream big and work hard. Believe in yourself and do not get discouraged nor disappointed when you fail. It is part of the process.

Lack of commitment? Not enough effort? Not enough support? Oh well, there are so many things could have gone wrong. Just know that you are not alone and there are so many people who also went through the same thing. These failures stopped them from dreaming and setting goals. But not you, my friend! You are not one of them. Here are 5 tips that will help you get back on your feet and achieve your success in life:\n<ol>\n <li><strong>Tell People</strong></li>\n</ol>\nWhen you have a dream, tell people around you about it. This way, you will get more motivated in achieving your goals. This is because every time you meet them, either they will ask you about your progress or you will be reminded that you must work on your targets. When you fail, however, you will feel that the embarrassment of having to tell them about your failures becomes a source of strength for you to man up. Think of them as if they are your accountability partners. While this step is sort of a double-edged sword for your face, it will fuel you to work extra hard to realize your dreams.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n <li><strong>Positive Mindset</strong></li>\n</ol>\nYou cannot achieve your goals if you do not even believe that you can! If not you, then who would? You should believe in yourself and that you can overcome the challenges along the way. You may be far from your dream now but at least you are moving. You are not who you were yesterday. You are better version of yourself today! Do not lose hope and stay positive.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n <li><strong>Set Your Mind on the Why</strong></li>\n</ol>\nAs mentioned in the previous post <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/index.php/2016/12/30/success-students/\">(link),</a> you should set your mind on the reason behind your goals. Instead of thinking about them, dwell on the “why this goal is important to you” and “why do you want to achieve them”. Knowing that you are pursuing greater things will motivate you to keep trying.\n<ol start=\"4\">\n <li><strong>Make It a Habit</strong></li>\n</ol>\nBrushing our teeth every day feels easy, doesn\'t it? You don\'t have to remind yourself or push yourself to brush your teeth, do you? You don\'t even have to think about it. You automatically do it as a part of your routine. The same goes with achieving your dream. If you want to accomplish your goals, you should make it your habit. Let\'s say you want to get healthier and want to exercise more. If you only exercise every time you remember about it, you would unlikely to attain that target by the end of the year. Instead, make exercising a daily habit. That way you are guaranteed to achieve your goal!\n<ol start=\"5\">\n <li><strong>Have Fun</strong></li>\n</ol>\nTime flies when you are having fun, right? You do not have to force yourself to work hard to reach your dream. So, just fave fun while you are doing it! Be creative on how you do it. Find other ways to make it more fun. You can even find a friend with the same goal and work together! However you do it, just make sure you enjoy the process as it is as important as the goal itself!\n\nWith these 5 tips, get back on your feet and keep dreaming! Do not be afraid to set big goals.

Our brain process information through three main inputs: sight, hearing and touch, meaning generally there are 3 types of learners; visual, auditory and kinetic.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Visual learners</strong> favor visual cues the most, which is why they prefer to read and write rather than listen. They can easily understand written directions but face issues with verbal instructions. They love books and newspapers. They write notes upon important information. The best trait of a visual learner is that he / she could read a map very easily.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Auditory learners</strong> are quite the opposite of the first category. They go for seminars and talks instead of visiting the library for books. They also have huge admiration for music. They could be easily spotted from the noises which surround them all the time, whether it is their own voices, or the discussion they tend to bring out with their group of friends.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third type of learner is <strong>kinetic</strong>. A kinetic learner processes information by performing actions. They need to move, tap, swing or even jump to stay focus. They use a lot of hand gestures. These are the type of practical learners as their brain works based on hands-on experience, such as lab work.</span>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><strong>Adjust your learning style</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you identified what type of learner you are, you can adjust the way you study.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are a visual learner, you will learn better using visualizations such as pictures, diagrams and infographics. Instead of memorizing the questions you are working on, jot them down on a list. Use color markers to mark, highlight or underline text as you reads and determine a color codes for example red for the critical information and blue for the interesting ones. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For auditory learner, equip yourself with a sound recorder, so you can quickly turn it on in a class and listen to it again thereafter. Have a partner to quiz you the lessons or set up a discussion group with your classmates. Make rhymes or abbreviation of lengthy and complex information. Summarize everything by saying them out loud.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A kinetic&nbsp;learner may needs a space to walk around while memorizing. Use your fingers while pointing down key information. You could also jump on your mattress while listening to seminars, squeeze a ball or even reading while riding on a stationary bicycle.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, you will understand that learning style is a personal preference. You could combine these styles to extend your own capabilities as long as you still feel comfortable with it.

In the 2+2 route, student will spend the first two years in a community college (and earn an associate degree if they stay for the full two years) and then transfer to a bachelor program in a university for the remaining 2 years. These institutions accept post-secondary students from various ages and academic backgrounds. Each route has its own advantages as you can read below.\n\n<u>&nbsp;</u>\n<h2><strong>Benefits of the 2+2 Route</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> Affordability</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nIf money is an issue for you, going to community college first is an excellent choice. This means you can take more classes that suit your interest since they are not as expensive as in university. Attending community college could also help you buy some time as you prepare your financial support for the upcoming university years.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> Flexible Schedule</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nIn contrast to university, class schedules in community college are relatively more flexible. It offers night classes and other options. If you plan to work while studying (remember that you can only work on-campus for a maximum of 20 hours a week as a F-1 visa holder), this would be the most convenient option.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> Accessible Classes</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nClasses generally have smaller size, as few as twenty students per class. Thus, it is possible for you to get more assistance from your professor. If you struggle in high school, attending community college first could help you prepare for university years.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Benefits of 4-Year University</h2>\n<ol>\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> Campus Life</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nAlthough you could join clubs and organizations in community colleges, the numbers and variety are incomparable to those in universities. If you want to taste the experience you see in movies about university, this route will certainly allow you to live it. It will help you expand not only your knowledge but also your social skills.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> Broader Options</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nThe most significant benefit of the 4-year university is the availability of rich educational options. Your options will not be limited as you can get more degree programs, majors and class options. For example, as a marketing student, you can get involved in graduate students\' research projects and get a minor in Biology or Physics.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> Rigorous Curriculum </strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nSince community colleges offer flexible schedules with lighter demands to accommodate literally everyone who wants to study, most students are not required to push their abilities to the limits. If you are a dedicated student who want to reach your fullest potential, community college may not be intellectually stimulating to you. In universities, you are encouraged to accomplish bigger goals and eventually push yourself harder.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWith its own advantages, you could be baffled to determine your choice.

A good recommendation letters does not only emphasize on what you do best, but also able to make you stand out from the other applicants. They use specific examples and concrete evidences to showcase your personal and academic strengths and progressions. Remember that the admission officers who read your letters receive thousands of similar letters, so make yours different. Nobody is created equal, so what people say about you must highlight this aspect vividly.\n\nYou can ask a teacher who has taught you long enough, e.g. your home-room teacher or your coach if you joined a sport club at school. You will have some advantage if these people also went to the school you are applying to!\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>\n<h3>Start early</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nContact your potential recommender as early as possible because they are busy and might need some time to compose an ideal letter for you. Asking their help in the last minute may make your letters look poorly written. In addition, starting this process early will give you opportunities to strengthen your connections and foster your relationships with your target teachers. Do not underestimate anybody, the teacher you dislike the most could be the one who is willing to write you one of these letters. This will also help you to develop social skills that are essential for your college life and career.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li>\n<h3>What to write<img class=\"alignright wp-image-1623 size-medium\" src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2016/05/resources-300x123.jpg\" alt=\"resources\" width=\"300\" height=\"123\"></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nAfter finding the recommender, the next step is to sort things out to put into the letter. The best letters provide information to the admission officer about you, the applicant. Since college life is more challenging than high school, colleges are looking for a student who has determination and passion. They want to know whether you can finish your study in college successfully. Even though you are a straight A\'s student, it is not always wise to mention this too much in the letters – the officer can check your grades card for that without your reminder. Instead, they want to see how you contribute to the overall learning experience of your class, how you interact and get along with others, and how you deal with struggles and challenges.\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li>\n<h3>Be strategic with the content of each letter</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nOften you are required to submit more than one letter of recommendation. So, make sure that each recommender writes about different aspects of you. Your letters of recommendation should not be redundant and they should each give new information about you. As you ask for a favor to your teachers, you can write a short note on what you would like to see in their letters. Depending on your experience with them, for instance, you may tell Teacher A to focus on your perseverance and hard work in overcoming challenges in his/her class. Then, you can tell Teacher B to focus on your social skills and how you are always willing to help your peers. And of course, make sure you have precedents and specific examples to support such claims.\n<ol start=\"5\">\n 	<li>\n<h3>Ensure technical aspects are correct</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nThe letters should be addressed to the admission director. Mention the university address correctly, and use \"Dear Sir / Madam,\" if you\'re unsure about the director\'s gender. Don\'t try to guess it from his / her name. You can easily find this information from the university\'s website.\n\nUse formal English for writing. It means the recommender should write \"do not\" instead of \"don\'t\" and \"I am\" instead of \"I\'m\". If the letter is handwritten, ensure that it could be easily read.\n\nYour name should also be written clearly, preferably in capital, accompanied with the proper salutation (Mr. / Miss). For example, if your name is John Smith, you could be addressed as Mr. Smith or John – using first name will make your letter sounds more personal. You should be addressed uniformly through the letter.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you still have doubts about this issue, feel free to <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/index.php/contact-us/\">contact us</a>.

You should view this period as a time to gain more experiences, not only for university application purposes but also for life learning. This is particularly important as when you finally get to college, you are more assured about what you want and what you are capable of. Listing some interesting activities such as working part-time or taking a French class might also boost your college admission. Various universities in America such as Harvard encourage incoming freshmen to take Gap Year. Malia Obama, who was accepted to Harvard, will spend her gap year learning about the movie business.\n\nWhy is this period so crucial for your university years? Some students are ready to face college life but most are simply not. College has more challenging academic workloads and requires you to think in a brand-new way than in high school. Consider gap year as a preparation period for you to embrace college life.\nHere are some things you could do during your gap year:\n\n<strong>1. Work</strong>\nTry to apply for a part-time job, something that you like to do. It does not have to be a paid job. Working will give you two benefits. Firstly, it will not only boost your CV but more importantly give a taste of what you like or not like to do. Secondly, you can collect some money to help your funding for the university.\n\n<strong>2. Study. Again.</strong>\nYes, this does sound boring, but as we already mentioned, not all students are ready to go to college. Some still desperately need \"tune-up\". Take a language course, for example, to learn how to compose academic writing or a public-speaking class to help build your confidence while doing a presentation.\n\n<strong>3. Travel</strong>\nYes, technically gap year is a \"holiday\" so you could certainly go somewhere. When you are in college, you will not have much time to do leisure activities without thinking of your exams, summer internships, and research projects. Traveling abroad can be a mind-expanding experience for you. This will also teach you to live independently, far away from your family support. The downside is, this might be expensive.\n\n<strong>4. Volunteer</strong>\nGap year could also be a perfect time for you to channel your passions by volunteering. You can join the local youth organization and help them with their activities or explore the jungle and go see the wildlife in their natural habitats if you\'re into an adventure. There is also some volunteer positions that will pay your service, so you will have the chance to get involve and earn some cash - the options are endless. Volunteering will add positive value to your personal branding.\n\n<strong>5. Sign-up for a competition</strong>\nIf you are good at writing, you might want to join a writing competition. If you are a dancer, look up for any available dancing competition. You can use these experiences to beef up your achievement section in your CV.

It normally takes four years to finish a bachelor program in the US. Whereas in the UK, you only need three years. Courses in UK universities are more focused towards your degree requirements, i.e. no or less elective subjects. In Scotland, however, a bachelor degree also takes four years.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: right;\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1831 alignright\" src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2017/04/pexels-photo-273011-150x150.jpeg\" alt=\"pexels-photo-273011\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><strong>Academic terms</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">In the US, the academic year starts in mid to late August for most universities. The second semester begins in early to mid January. In the UK, semester starts in September or October and ends in May or June. Both countries have long breaks at the end of the year for Christmas and New Year. Academic year in UK is slightly longer. There are universities which use tri-semester or quarter-based system in both countries.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Grades and assignments</strong></h3>\nSince UK universities compact their courses in three years, assignments are only given occasionally. It is possible that there are no actual assignments. In this case, grades will solely be determined by final exams. This makes exams become more \"challenging\" in UK. In the US, grading is based on the combination of your performances: class participation, assignments, midterms and final exams. It tends to be more of a holistic evaluation. You could expect frequent assignments; more essays, research and presentations throughout the semester.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Admission process</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A lot of UK universities are actually collections of colleges with a specific subject. This means you need to apply to<img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1833 alignright\" src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2017/04/document-agreement-documents-sign-48148-150x150.jpeg\" alt=\"document-agreement-documents-sign-48148\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /> the college rather than to the central university admission. There is also a dedicated system called Universities and Colleges Admissions Services (UCAS). UCAS allows you to apply to a few colleges at once. This centralized system requires you to know exactly what you want to study before you apply. Important to note, you are only allowed to apply to up to five colleges. We have covered UCAS before, click <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/index.php/2016/09/04/applying-uk-universities/\">here </a>if you wish to find out more.</p>\nIn the US, you apply through the Common App platform. It is a centralized system. Each university can customize their own application requirements including the number of essays and questions. Unlike in the UK, you can still apply as “undecided” if you are not sure what you want to study yet. You only need to confirm your major by the end of the second year in university.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Cost</strong></h3>\n<img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1834\" src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2017/04/pexels-photo-164661-150x150.jpeg\" alt=\"pexels-photo-164661\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />Tuition rates for both countries are the highest in the world according to various sources. It is generally higher in the US though. In the UK, university tuition and costs are governed by a law. There is a standardized limit for each educational level. Universities are free to set up their own costs up to that limit. By contrast, in the US, universities are more independent in determining their costs. Private universities cost more than public universities in both countries.

For those of you who are going to study in the US, this is an almost inevitable part of the process. Admission officers use the interview to get to know you more; they want to make sure that you are a suited candidate to study at their institution.\n\nHere&nbsp;are some of the most commonly asked questions in university admission application interviews and how to best answer them!\n<ol>\n 	<li>\n<h4>Why do you apply to our university?</h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\nInterviewer uses this question to dissect your motivation on applying to their university. Make sure you did a thorough research about the university and why they appeal to you. Emphasize some of its strengths and relate them with your personal interest. Bonus point if you can articulate why you will be a good asset to them.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>\n<h4>Tell us about yourself!</h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\nThis question is pretty straight-forward but the answer might not be as simple. This is your chance to \"sell\" yourself. Use verbs more than adjectives to describe your personalities. Instead of over-dramatizing your accomplishments, tell the interviewer how you achieve them and what you learned from the process. Describe how you tackle challenges and overcome your weaknesses.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li>\n<h4>What activities do you enjoy the most? What is your goal after college?</h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\nThey want to know about your priorities in life. Emphasize on how studying in that university could help you reach your future goals. Avoid describing impossible goals such as going to the moon, but stick to the practical one, such as having your own software company. However, remember to stay genuine and honest. Do not say things just to please the interviewer.\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li>\n<h4>What is your opinion about (an issue on the news lately)?</h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\nThe interviewer wants to see the way you think, how you value yourself and how you perceive things. He or she also wants to test your level of curiosity, whether you are an \"up-to-date\" person or rather an \"outdated\" one. Make sure you are well-informed about the current news.\n<ol start=\"5\">\n 	<li>\n<h4>If you win a lottery of one million dollars, what would you do?</h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\nThis is a tricky question, be careful not to get too enthusiastic. In interviews,&nbsp;this type of questions is asked&nbsp;to dig more into your personality. Colleges need a potential student that is able to balance future goals and practical approaches, so you need to give an answer that combines both of these aspects. Remember not to&nbsp;come up with an overly self-centered answer.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>More tips on how to ace your interviews:</h4>\n<ul>\n 	<li>\n<h5>Practice and practice, but do not memorize a script. Be a natural conversationalist.</h5>\n</li>\n 	<li>\n<h5>Show interests by asking questions. It is important to make the interview lively and smooth to show the interviewer that you are looking forward to be admitted at the institution.</h5>\n</li>\n 	<li>\n<h5>Be yourself. This could be the most cliché tip of all, but it always works. Originality is an important point in&nbsp;an interview. It makes you stand out from the crowd.</h5>\n</li>\n 	<li>\n<h5>As part of our consulting services, ALL-in Eduspace provides practice interviews!

The good news is, you can tackle it with proper\npreparation. &nbsp;In this article, we are discussing some SAT myths, which you might have heard before,&nbsp;and differentiating them with facts.\n<h4><strong>&nbsp;Myth: Your SAT score is going to highly impact your chance to be admitted</strong></h4>\nFact: Some students are too focused to get the highest SAT score possible that they forget other aspects. SAT is one of the criteria. It is important, but not the sole factor that determines your admission decision. Universities, especially the top-tiers, are looking for students with 3Ps (Passion, Purpose, Potential). This means you also need to develop other things such as a positive personal branding and abilities like organizational skills. Admission officers will look at your track record in high school and put them into consideration along with your SAT score.\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4><strong>&nbsp;Myth: Only smart students can beat the SAT</strong></h4>\nFact: This is obviously an erroneous idea. The goal of the SAT is to test your reasoning. This means no matter how vast your knowledge is, if you are still unable to think logically, you will still find the test hard. SAT has 3 sections: math, reading and writing (essay is optional) and it contains real-world-contextual questions, so regardless of your academic background, you could handle them and get a desirable score. Remember, preparation is the key!\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4><strong>&nbsp;Myth: Since the essay part is optional, I could skip it!</strong></h4>\nFact: It is true that you can opt out of the essay writing, but doing it will not harm your score either. Finishing the essay will help your admission instead – the admission officer will take it as a determining factor when decision-making is on the fence. It is also a safe choice because you would need to retake the entire test once again if eventually the university you apply to ask for the SAT essay as part of the requirements.\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4><strong>&nbsp;Myth: I could prepare solely by studying from the SAT prep-books.</strong></h4>\nFact: We agree that some SAT preparation books are really helpful. But there are also not-so-recommended books. Be careful when you pick the SAT books. Getting help from private tutors could boost your performance too, especially if your tutor can tailor the SAT drills according to your needs. Your tutor can also serve as a partner to discuss SAT questions and you can get personalized feedback – such things even the best books can\'t do J. We believe everyone is unique thus generalizing the learning process is inadequate.\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4><strong>&nbsp;Myth: SAT preparation course is expensive!</strong></h4>\nFact: It is unworthy to jeopardize your admission by taking \"affordable\" preparation course. You are almost done with high school, so you do not need to relearn everything for your SAT. The tests have recurring patterns so what you really need to learn is a working strategy to decode it – and a reputable SAT preparation course provider should arm you with it.\n\n<hr>\n\nThe point is, do not let the SAT scare you. Like we always say, starting early and good preparation are the keys! Equally important is that you should not settle with just a regular preparation, but a strategic and personal one.

We call it challenging because it requires a lot, from mental and intellectual preparation to strong financial support. It may not be for everyone, but anyone with proper determination can certainly make it. However, some of you may still have doubts about going abroad for study.&nbsp; There are already some good universities in Indonesia, providing qualified programs and they are more affordable. You do not have to travel thousands of miles only to reach the campus, or master a new foreign language to attend the class.\n\nIn this article we are addressing the big question: <strong>why study abroad?</strong> What will it give you? Below we have listed some reasons which hopefully can help you make decision.\n<ol>\n 	<li><strong> More support system</strong></li>\n</ol>\nEvery stage of education will expand your knowledge. Regardless of whether you are studying in Indonesia or abroad, you will certainly experience this. But the best learning process must also be supported by extensive facilities. Such supports are still fairly limited in our country – especially if you plan to pursue advance program like nanotechnology. Some foreign universities like those in the US provide their students with world-class (sometimes even world\'s best) research facilities. Study at such university will give you a rare support that you will always be grateful for.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li><strong> Hone your foreign language skill</strong></li>\n</ol>\nIf you ask us the best way to master Chinese language, we will certainly suggest that you take a language course directly in China. In terms of language learning, direct exposure to the native-speaker community will give you the best result. This is what you will get in addition to your study in a foreign country – you have higher probability to master a new language faster and more effectively.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li><strong> Personal development</strong></li>\n</ol>\nTo live in a brand-new environment is sometimes intimidating – you may feel homesick quite often in the beginning. We get it, there is no place like home. But staying in a comfort zone will not help you grow personally, taking on challenges will. Study abroad will help cultivate yourself, for example it will bring your independent nature, problem solving skill and open-mindedness towards diversity.&nbsp; You will be surprised to see how much you have grown after finishing your study.\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li><strong> Career Opportunities</strong></li>\n</ol>\nBeing an alumnus of a foreign university can boost your CV, making you stand out from the crowd during job hunting. In fact, some companies specifically seek for employees with international background.&nbsp; With appropriate arrangement, you can also work in your host country or continue to graduate study. The options are limitless.\n<ol start=\"5\">\n 	<li><strong> Growing your social network</strong></li>\n</ol>\nMost people will agree that having a vast social connection is beneficial. In foreign university, you will make friends with other people from various nationalities and cultural background. It is a good chance for you to polish your social skills and establish new connections with your fellows. Who knows that one of your foreign friends can help you in your future career?\n<h3>In the end, study abroad is a good investment for you. Do not be discouraged if money is an issue for you, there are plenty of <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/study-abroad-scholarship-application-prep/\">scholarships</a> available. We encourage you to prepare yourself to the best and take this opportunity as soon as possible; you will never regret it.</h3>', '', 'The basic question: why study abroad?', 'publish', 'The basic question: why study abroad?', 'why study abroad?', 'In this article we are addressing the big question: why study abroad?

Therefore, now is an excellent time to study majors such as computer science, information technology, interactive design, biotechnology or artificial intelligence.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> Healthcare and Medicine</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nAlong with the improvement of our wealth, people are going to demand for qualified and better healthcare and medical service. It is going to become a lucrative field as Indonesia is one of the world\'s most populous countries. Occupations like doctors, surgeons, nurses and other medical practitioners will continue to be highly sought.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> Engineering</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nEvery major progress starts with infrastructure and transportation development. Recently we have already witnessed how the government enthusiastically build new roads, harbours and airports in many cities in Indonesia. As a primary pillar of economic growth, such development will need massive human resources support. It means majors like civil engineering, urban planning, architecture, transportation management, maritime and aeronautical studies will contribute a lot later in 2045.\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> Public Policy and Governance</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nAs our country grows, it needs firmer and fairer governance. Although it sounds quite tedious, political studies will not only teach you how to become a legit decision maker, but also train you to think strategically and critically to provide the best solution for the country\'s problems.&nbsp; If it is too mundane, you can try other complementary majors such as communication or management.\n<ol start=\"5\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> Environmental sciences</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nIndonesia owns a tremendous amount of natural resources. Our government has been using them to motorize the nation\'s economy. In the future, their amount will decrease and without eco-oriented management, vanish. To accommodate these needs, majors in petroleum, forestry, precision production, conservation and business administration can be your choice of study now.\n\nThe above majors are definitely promising. However, any study program that you choose will have positive contributions to the future of this nation in its own way. You can use this information as a guide to help you choose your major but always remember to pick the one that suits your interest best.

They have top-quality education and plenty of world-class universities. Yet, we know, these countries might be just a little bit too mainstream and less-intriguing for those who love adventures. For those people, we recommend Europe. Europe has a lot of universities with similar excellence to offer. Studying in countries like France or Germany may sound tempting. We have listed some of the benefits you will gain and the challenges that you may encounter, for your consideration.\n<h2><strong>Why you should choose Europe as your study destination?</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n 	<li>\n<h3>Similar best-quality, but more affordable</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nEurope universities give you extra flexibility financially. You can choose a program that costs thousands of Euros from a private university in Switzerland, or an almost zero-cost major from a public university in Germany. Such difference in costs does not necessarily affect the quality of education though. Most programs in Europe universities are internationally standardized with comparable academic rigor to those in the US or UK. The tuition discrepancy is caused by different approaches . Each university in Europe has its own method to determine the tuition for international students, but they are all supervised by the government.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>\n<h3>Travel opportunity</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2196 alignright\" src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2017/08/pexels-photo-164212-300x200.jpeg\" alt=\"pexels-photo-164212\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />Studying in Europe is an opportunity for you to fill all those blank pages in your passport. You can just hop on a train (or take the budget airlines) and visit France, Belgium, Netherlands, Spain and Italy all at once during your summer holiday. Since most European countries are united in Euro-zone, you only need a single visa to visit them all, which is the <a href=\"https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/\">Schengen Visa</a>.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li>\n<h3>Master new language</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nIf you already can speak in English - that is good. Imagine if you could also speak  in French or Svenska, for example, that\'d be extraordinary! Although there are plenty of programs delivered in English, you still need to learn the local language to survive in your daily life. You can take language courses offered by the universities (in some cases, for free) to help you expand your social life and master another new language!\n<h2><strong>Some obstacles or challenges you might face:</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n 	<li>\n<h3>Settling in</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nYes, it is impressive to master another foreign language beside English, but for most people, learning a new language may not be a simple task. You need extra patience and bravery to practice a new language and study your subjects at the same time. As you move into a new country, you will need to find your accommodation. Unlike in the US, the concept of dorm life in Europe is entirely foreign. You must find your own housing, which could be a hassle when you are new into the country. Research early!\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>\n<h3>Different educational approach</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nAccording to various sources, European universities use exams as a primary mode of grading. You are expected to take a more active role in classes and daily life.

If you are not properly prepared, you may feel lost in the process. You will encounter not only a dozen of requirements, but also plenty of new terms you might have not heard before. Do not panic. In this article, we have listed some of the most common admission terms and what they mean to help you.\n<ol>\n 	<li>\n<h3>LOA = Letter of Acceptance</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nYou will receive your LOA as a sign that you are admitted to the university. Generally, there are two types of LOA: conditional and unconditional. Receiving a conditional LOA means that you still need to meet some requirements, for example the required TOEFL score. If you receive unconditional LOA, congratulations, you have completed all the requirements! However, receiving an unconditional LOA does not necessarily mean you have secured your seat – &nbsp;you need to respond to it by accepting or declining the offer.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>\n<h3>CRDA = Candidates Reply Date Agreement</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nCRDA is a deadline within which you should respond to the offer. Universities will give you enough time to consider and receive responses from other universities that you applied to. Be careful though, the offer will expire&nbsp;after the given date, so consider your choice wisely.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li>\n<h3>LOG = Letter of Guarantee</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nAfter receiving unconditional LOA, the next thing you need is a LOG. In most cases, you are only eligible to apply for student visa when the university releases your LOG. To receive a LOG, you need to meet further requirements, such as paying the tuition fee.\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li>\n<h3>Deferral / Deferred Admission</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nYou could request a postponement of your study at the university. You will need to provide a valid reason of your deferral. Universities have different rules for deferral, but the postponement is usually applicable for up to one year.\n<ol start=\"5\">\n 	<li>\n<h3>Common Application (Common App) and UCAS</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nCommon Application is a universal application form for extensive number of universities in the US. Through the Common App, you can apply to various universities in one go. <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/applying-uk-universities/\">UCAS</a>, similarly, is the UK equivalent of the Common App.\n<ol start=\"5\">\n 	<li>\n<h3>Open admission</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nOpen admission means that they accept all high school graduates regardless of their backgrounds and grades until the class quotas are filled. This&nbsp;policy is usually adopted by two-year community colleges.\n<ol start=\"6\">\n 	<li>\n<h3>Accelerated study</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nAs the name implies, this program allows you to finish your study a year earlier than the general undergraduate study period. You may be required to take extra courses during holidays to accelerate your study period.\n<ol start=\"7\">\n 	<li>\n<h3>Honors program</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nThis program gives you a richer study experience than the regular program through small class size, mentoring, hands-on research or custom-designed courses. In some cases the university will encourage you to take this program depending on your grades.\n<h3>Still puzzled by the terms and the admission process?

You will probably think of a smartphone that is compact, reliable, and fast with great camera performance and legions of fans. That is an example of a <strong>powerful</strong> and <strong>positive</strong> <strong>branding</strong>.\n\nHaving a positive personal branding is critical for your university application process (in fact, in any stage of your life). Branding is a way in which you present yourself in front of other people, in this case, the admission officers. You want them to think that you are the right candidate for their university. A unique profile is the key to get accepted in your dream school.\n<h2>The big question is what kind of personal branding that will make you an attractive candidate?</h2>\nThe answer is a holistic personal branding. Your brand should not just be a list of awards that you accomplished during high school. It should convey how you attain those achievements: reflect on your progress, your way of thinking, and your method to handle problems.\n\nSo you need to be seen as a unique individual who has few aspects that are worth remembering by the admission officers. Do not force yourself to be the jack of all trades, or worse, to lie about your own qualities.  The trick is to <strong>polish</strong> what you have in a promising package.\n\nFor example, you only join one student organization in high school. Listed as is, you could be perceived as lacking social and organizational skills. Therefore, you need to explain your thought process. You can say that you prefer to stay in a single organization rather than in multiple ones because you like to focus on the depth of your involvement. Repackaging what seems to be your weakness could boost your chances in the university admission process.\n\nAnother important aspect is <strong>originality</strong>. You need to find the ‘hook factor\' that will make your application stand out from the others. Be confident, everyone is unique in their own way. Never think that you are not special – you just need to do some soul searching and dig deep into your life to figure it out. It could be something that is seemingly unimportant to you. Make sure that it relates to the university you plan to apply to. For example, you love animals and you are applying for an Arts program. While these two do not seem to be related at all, you can highlight your passion in visiting every single zoo in your country and spend hours there drawing herd of animals you see.\n<h2>What to include and what not to include in your personal branding?</h2>\nNow that you know how to package your brand, the next thing to master is how to be selective: only pick the important parts. You are not expected to explain everything on your application and interview. Admission officers do like good grades and extracurricular activities but be cautious not to bore them. Remember, they review thousands of applications each year. Show your empathy. For instance, you can skip a piano class that you took back in the 5<sup>th</sup> grade. Instead, you can mention your contribution in high school choir and how your team won the regional competition. You will be seen as an active team player and a goal-oriented person. Remember, interesting does not always mean that it is important.\n\nIn the end, a good personal branding should <strong>make you ‘sell\'</strong> like an iPhone: beautiful, reliable and desirable. This is not an easy task, most student end up over-dramatizing their application which only lead to unfavorable results. Having a friend to help you list your qualities is an excellent option: you need a mirror to see how you look.

There are a lot of scholarships available worldwide. In our previous blog articles, we have mentioned several scholarship opportunities that you can try (<a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/scholarships-government-sponsorship/\">blog I</a>, <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/scholarships-government-sponsorship-ii/\">blog II</a>). Applying for scholarship is not an easy process—proper preparations can improve your chance to win one. Here we will discuss what you need to prepare for your scholarship application.</h2>\n<ol>\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> The Language Requirement</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nWhether it is IELTS, TOELF, or any other English language certification, in most cases this is the first requirement that you need to fulfill to be eligible for a scholarship. Most applicants underestimate the importance of language certification which causes unnecessary delays in their application process. So the first thing you need to accomplish is to pass the required language requirement - after that you are good to prepare the others.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> Letter of Acceptance (LoA)</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nMost scholarships require Letter of Acceptance from your desired university. You should apply to more than one university to increase your chances. Pick several universities of various calibers (you can check the university rank from THE or QS University Ranking). At this point, you do not have to worry about the funding yet. After you have your English language certification, make sure you have unconditional LoA.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> Essays and Personal Statement</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nMost scholarships require personal statements in form of essays. Compose the best essays you can - ensure you use the correct grammar and tenses. Usually, the personal statement has a limit of 500 words. Try to be brief, compact but clear. Do not hesitate to seek help – ask your peers or tutors to review your essays.  Look for essay samples from successful candidates for more guidance or to find inspirations. However, do not plagiarize. Be original, honest and motivated. This is the chance to show the scholarship committee that you are the right person to get financial support.\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> Practice Interview</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nIf you pass the document selection round, you may proceed to the interview stage.  This stage is typically another frightening stage for most applicants. If you have experienced job interview session before, this would be somewhat similar. The committee will assess your motivation and personality. Some standard questions such as \"Tell us about yourself\" or \"What makes you the best candidate for this scholarship?\" will certainly pop up. Practice those questions but do not sound like you are reading a script. Do not be intimidated. Be calm and answer all the questions as genuinely and confidently as possible. Some scholarships such as the Swedish Institute Scholarship, however, do not require an interview.\n<ol start=\"5\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> The paperwork</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nMake a list of required documents for your scholarship application submission. Sometimes, paperwork could overwhelm you, so double check everything. Put all the documents in a dedicated folder – preferably with plastic case to protect them from damage, e.g. rain. Also, it is better to prepare all documents in English. If your transcript or high school certificate is in Bahasa, you may need to translate them into English first.\n\n<strong> </strong>\n<h2><strong>Tips:</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Most interview sessions are intentionally designed to make you feel intimidated. It is to test how the applicants perform under pressure.</li>\n 	<li>If you are applying online, it is better to submit your applications a few days before the deadline to avoid technical issues such as server breakdown.</li>\n 	<li>Some scholarships have specific requirements about document translation. For example, you could only use several translator services selected by the committee or through the local embassy. Check the scholarship website for the most accurate information.</li>\n 	<li>ALL-in Eduspace has launched a dedicated scholarship preparation course and workshop to help you prepare and win for the scholarship you are eyeing!

One of the most important component in a college application package is your personal statement. Personal statement, or also called Statement of Purpose, is an article written by the college applicant where he/she talks about his/her background, motivation in pursuing a particular degree, and also what he/she plans to do with the degree upon his/her graduation from the program. Another way to look at Personal Statement is to view it as a 2-page opportunity for an applicant to persuade the college admission committee why he/she is the perfect candidate for the department he/she is applying to.\n\nPersonal Statement is such an important piece of the college application package and it carries a lot of weight in the college admission process. In this short article, we are discussing Personal Statement that is of a format normally required for UK undergraduate and US graduate school applications. US undergraduate applications may require an application essay with a different format and content. Here are some important tips to help you write a great Personal Statement.\n<ol>\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong><u> You have to write a UNIQUE Personal Statement</u></strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nThe reason why this advice is at the top of this list and why the word <strong>UNIQUE</strong> is in capital letters is because of the number of Personal Statements that an admission committee have to read through. Competitive universities and programs receive thousands of applications each year. The sheer number of applications forces the admission committee to make a quick judgment on the applicants. There have been some articles written describing that an admission committee may spend time as short as less than 30 seconds for reading Personal Statements. That is a very short window of opportunity to impress the admission committee!\n\nThink about the most unique project that you have done or the most unique extracurricular activity that you have joined. How about the most unique accomplishment that you have made? What\'s the most unique thing about you? You are presenting yourself to an admission committee that read thousands of Personal Statements and you only have less than 30 seconds. Therefore, you have to mention why you are unique in the beginning part of your Personal Statement and make sure that attribute sets you apart from the other applicants. Make sure your Personal Statement is memorable to the reader. Get as many friends as you can to read your Personal Statement and ask them to describe it in three words. If those three words are the unique attributes you would like to highlight to the admission committee, then you have a great Personal Statement right there!\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong><u> Go straight to the points</u></strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nPoint number two here is still related to the fact that an applicant only has a very narrow window of opportunity to impress the admission committee. The most common mistake that many applicants make when it comes to Personal Statement is to write a long-winded story about themselves and spread themselves too thin by pointing out too many achievements. With only two pages allowed, it is a wiser strategy to write a Personal Statement that goes straight to the points.\n\nRight off the bat, talk about your best accomplishments. We suggest focusing on <u>not more</u> than four of your best accomplishments, with the first three accomplishments mentioned in the first two paragraphs, and the whole story leading up to your greatest and most recent one in the second page of the Personal Statement. The idea here is to get the reader engaged within the first 30 seconds by flashing your three accomplishments and build the suspense which will eventually lead up to the climax; your greatest and most recent accomplishment. By going straight to the three major accomplishments in the beginning part of the Personal Statement, you make sure that you intrigue the reader and keep him/her wanting to know more about you.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong><u> In your Personal Statement, YOU are the main character in the story</u></strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nUse the power of words to invoke positive feelings in the readers\' minds as they read your Personal Statement. As mentioned in tips #2 above, flash three of your great accomplishments in the beginning of the article and then build some story leading up to the climax; your greatest accomplishment. Share about how you got the insight (e. g. your “Eureka” moment) that led you to achieving your greatest accomplishment. You can also share about the main result of that accomplishment (e.g. “I created a solar cell with 15% efficiency, which was the world record at that time”). Show your human emotion in your words and make the readers feel they are there celebrating your greatest accomplishment with you.\n\nMany people tend to downplay their abilities and accomplishments. We tend to compare ourselves to others and oftentimes, our insecurity tells us that what we have accomplished is not big enough. The reality is, your accomplishment is great and worth sharing with the world. If you overcome your insecurity and learn some presentation (e. g. persuasive writing) skills, you can convince other people that your accomplishment is something beyond ordinary.\n<h3 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">4.<strong><u>Learn and get inspirations from others</u></strong></h3>\nOne piece of advice in writing a persuasive story for your Personal Statement is to read some sample Personal Statements of past applications who got accepted to top universities in your major of study. <a href=\"http://www.google.com\">Google </a>this and you will be able to find some great Personal Statement where you can get a lot of ideas. Read as many as you can find and study how each of these Personal Statements deliver their “punch line”. You will find yourself in awe after reading some of these great Personal Statements. Learn the writing styles of these articles, mix them with your personalities, and start writing your own.\n<h2><strong>In conclusion</strong></h2>\nThere you have them! Those are some tips to help you compose a great Personal Statement. As mentioned in tip #3, read as many Personal Statements as possible, especially those that landed the applicants offers from multiple top universities. You can get a bunch of great ideas from these sources. Focus LESS on what you aspire to do in the future and focus MORE on what you have accomplished in the past. Having a big dream is easy – it is only words and promises. However, by sharing what you actually have accomplished, you show that you have big dreams and you achieved them!\n\nAs a closing note, try to get as many friends as possible to read your draft and critique it for you. When the whole article already seems to be so perfect in your eyes, give it to your friends and ask for their opinions. Often, they will be able to give you insights that you are oblivious to. Iterate, get inputs, read others\' Personal Statement to get ideas, and repeat to perfection.

Centuries later, Einstein generalized the former and unified it with the latter in his relativity theory in 1916. The world in early 20<sup>th</sup> century also witnessed the fall of the classical atomic physics and the reign of the quantum mechanics, which could explain wider range of physical phenomenon at atomic scale. Presently, though physics and other natural sciences are still aggressively progressing, the way I see it, the 21<sup>th</sup> century will be the era where applied sciences triumph. This is the period where accumulated knowledge and well understood theories are transformed into real life applications. This period will also allow indulgence in working on scientific problems, which, if solved, would foster societal advancement. The abovementioned point of view and personal driving force confide me that applied science is the direction I would like to set my graduate studies to.\n\nDreaming to be a mathematician when I was in secondary school, I was quickly swayed by physics in high school. Though I enjoyed doing mathematics, I was much more absorbed with the application of mathematics in physics itself. Excelling at the subject, I was given the opportunity to represent my high school in physics Olympiad and obtained the first place in East Jakarta region and bronze medal at national level. The end of high school did not end my affinity for physics; in fact, it led me to study the subject at higher level by majoring physics at School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (SPMS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU).\n\nAt NTU, besides taking regular classes, I realized that SPMS presented me opportunity to immense myself into world-class cutting-edge research. In the second semester, I started working on a project with Prof Lars Egil Helseth; studies on ferromagnetic materials which had potential application for magnetic sensor. I employed magneto-optic imaging technique using Kerr and Faraday effects to map the magnetization vector in the region near crack lines in ferrite garnet film of composition Lu<sub>2.5</sub>Bi<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>4.9</sub>Ga<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>12</sub>. The polarization of the incoming probe light will be altered after passing through the magnetized film. By measuring the polarization shift, the magnetization profile of an area on the film could then be determined. My work with Prof Helseth resulted in my very first contribution to scientific community, a Physical Review B publication titled “Large domain walls near crack lines in ferromagnetic garnet films”. Within several months after the project was concluded, I found out that Prof Alfred Huan and Prof Tze Chien Sum just started a project on organic light emitting diode (OLED). This project quickly pulled me into it as the goal was clear yet challenging; to find out why an OLED is efficient or inefficient by investigating the underlying physical processes at molecular scale. This work was highly relevant with low cost efficient lighting applications. I began by familiarizing myself with the device engineering by working in Organic Electronics Laboratory, where the main equipments (e.g. thermal evaporator and twin-glove box systems) were located. I also performed film and device characterization using atomic force microscope, x-ray diffraction, linear absorption, photoluminescence emission, cyclic voltammetry, etc. In optical spectroscopy part of the work, I built time-resolved spectroscopy setup in Xc-Lab integrating streak camera, monochromator, and pulse generator, which has been being used by other group members for time-resolved measurement. The OLED system I studied was Ir(ppy)<sub>3</sub>, an organometallic emitter with 100% internal quantum efficiency. This project was continuation from a publication that the previous post-doctoral researcher had done in Xc-Lab, in which an OLED device with external quantum efficiency of 20% was achieved. Employing the streak camera-based time-resolved electroluminescence setup, I monitored the wavelength-resolved emission profile of the Ir(ppy)<sub>3</sub>-based OLED device as function of time as it was being excited by pulsed electrical bias. The emission profile could then reveal the dynamics of the excited states population. The effort spent during my final undergraduate year eventually culminated with my thesis titled “Time-resolved electroluminescence on organometallic triplet emitter” which I presented at ICMAT MRS 2009 as a relatively new method to study the electroluminescence dynamics of OLED devices. For this project and my undergraduate academic record, I was awarded the first class honors in Physics with minor in Mathematics. Around this period, the group expanded and the research focus shifted towards alternative energy application. After discussions with Prof Huan and Prof Sum, I decided to explore organic photovoltaic (OPV) and work under their supervision as a research assistant upon graduation. Besides these two professors, I also started working with Prof Cesare Soci, who joined NTU around this timeframe. Due to his experience in optical spectroscopy and organic semiconductors, discussions with him have always been intense and have resulted in ideas which I utilized to create forward thrusts in my research work.\n\nIn OPV, I look at the exciton dissociation at the donor-acceptor interface. With the femtosecond laser (75 fs) in Xc-Lab lab, physical processes happening at ultrafast time scale such as electron (and energy) transfer can be observed using home-built white light transient absorption setup. I employed this technique to look at the charge transfer efficiency in OPV systems such as P3HT:PCBM and water-soluble polymer:fullerene. We found large number of charges in several water-soluble polymer:fullerene systems, judging from the unrecovered bleaching signal in the transient absorption spectra. However, the device performance was low, hinting poor charge transfer or charge collection at active layer-electrode interface. After optimizing the phase segregation and active layer-electrode interface, I found that the device\'s power conversion efficiency was enhanced up to 0.2%. For water-based OPV, this is considered high, as the highest efficiency is still less than 1%. The findings on this project are being summarized in a manuscript that I am currently writing. The second project that I have been working on is a collaborative work with Prof Lam Yeng Ming from School of Material Science and Engineering, NTU. With her, I have been focusing on nanofiber-P3HT, correlating its device performance with the optical spectroscopy data. Nanofiber system exhibits high efficiency without post-thermal annealing, unlike the conventional regioregular-P3HT, which could potentially realize OPV on plastic substrate with low glass transition temperature. Indeed, from transient absorption measurement, I found that the exciton dissociation was efficient. I also devised a method to improve the active layer-electrode interface without resorting to thermal annealing at one point in this project. Based on the findings from this work, I am preparing the second manuscript for publication. One side project that I have been exploring is ternary blend OPV employing low band gap polymers to assist P3HT:PCBM harvest photons in the low energy regime. The challenge I am facing now is doping P3HT:PCBM without compromising its optimum nanostructures. Lastly, the most recently initiated work was on the insertion of ferroelectric material in OPV to inhibit charge recombination. We are probing the lifetime lengthening of the charges using transient absorption at timescale from 100 fs to 1 ms. At this very moment, under supervision of Prof Huan, Prof Sum and Prof Soci, I am devising a method to perform optical pump-probe measurement on functional device.\n\nContributing to the advancement of society will remain my strongest driving force to do research on renewable energy and advanced devices. I would like to be the agent who brings sciences from laboratories to useful applications that improve people\'s quality of life. Having been working on both device engineering and optical spectroscopy makes me well rounded and able to grasp wider range of concepts in organic semiconductors in particular and solid-state physics in general. I have decided to set the next phase of my education in material science and engineering, and have learned that Stanford University would be the perfect fit for me to learn how to engineer and put science into effective uses. I believe my research experience on organic semiconductors, which parallels with the works of Prof Michael McGehee and Prof Alberto Salleo will put me straight to the front of their cutting-edge research. Moreover, with my physics background in general and optical spectroscopy in particular, I believe I will be able to bring in some important physics perspectives to the group. I will be very happy for the admission to Stanford University and will strive to make as much contribution as I possibly can to the research group, the university, and the society.\n\n##########\n\n<strong><em><u>Word Counts: 1386</u></em></strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><strong>Statement of Purpose 2</strong></h2>\nMy mother always believed that I would grow up to be someone intelligent and useful for the society. Proof of her strong faith is the surname she gave me; Kurniawan, which translates to “gift to the world” in Indonesian. Honestly, I had been taking it only for granted as a kid. However, I started to seriously think about ways to contribute to the society when I was about to attend university. A thought of becoming a scientist was never absent in my mind since I represented my high school in Physics Olympiad and obtained National Medals. As it turned out, the competition was a life-changing experience, which eventually answered the question I had been pondering. I realized that I could contribute to the society with Physics by creating innovations for real life applications.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBesides keeping my GPA near maximum, I also immersed myself in various research works as much as I could during undergraduate. Excelling the physics in class was very important. However, it was even more crucial to actually apply the physics learned in class to the laboratory. The research atmosphere in the young Physics Department of NTU was highly conducive for independent learner. In all groups I worked in, the faculty always gave me freedom to invent and grow original ideas. Moreover, close interactions with the faculty also made my research experience fruitful and productive. In the end, besides obtaining 1<sup>st</sup> Class Honours, I also published and presented several scientific publications.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen joining research groups, I always put effort to do something substantial. I had my first research experience earlier than most students. In the second semester, I started working on characterization of a particular ferrite garnet film, which could be utilized for magnetic sensors, and components of lab-on-a-chip. I mapped the magnetization vectors of the film employing Kerr and Faraday effects and constructed a comprehensive physical model to describe its unique profile. The work resulted in my very first contribution to science; Physical Review B publication titled “Large domain walls near crack lines in ferromagnetic garnet films”.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWorking on fundamental studies in the ferrimagnetic project was truly pleasurable, especially the modelling part of the work. The “Eureka!” feeling was unforgettable. There was a part of me that just wanted to enjoy physics and nothing else. However, I could not stop thinking about the gap between materials characterization and materials integration (into device). Both are equally important and necessary in technology development. This was when I approached Prof Alfred Huan and shared my thoughts with him. Prof Huan was very understanding and encouraged me to explore both physics and device aspects of Organic semiconductors. Moreover, besides performing experiments in laboratory, I also had the chance to “build” the laboratory itself. Under his supervision, I designed and developed optical spectroscopy setups and device fabrication systems in my Final Year Project and Research Assistantship upon graduation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe first part of the project was to set up Time-Resolved Photoluminescence and Time-Resolved Electroluminescence system integrating femtosecond laser, streak camera, monochromator, and pulse generator. This work required understanding in the detailed working mechanism of the components, experimental skills with ultrafast laser, and precise alignment of the optical components. Eventually, I managed to complete the project before the projected timeline and presented it at ICMAT-MRS 2009 as a novel technique to study the energy/charge transfer dynamics in Organic devices.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the second part of the work, I extensively employed the abovementioned systems (in conjunction with Femtosecond Transient Absorption) to probe Nanofiber-P3HT:PCBM. I observed that the charge transfer was highly efficient but the charge collection was not. Thus, I started attempting to enhance the active layer-electrode interface, but without eliminating the free-thermal merit of this system. When I explained it, everyone thought it was a dead end. However, I came up with an idea to carefully apply certain magnitude of pressure on the device. I demonstrated that not only the issue was solved but the PCE also increased by 10%. Finding out that this tricky idea worked made me really excited. It was another “Eureka!” moment I will never forget. The work was presented at the E-MRS 2011 and has been submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. At the same time, I am leading 2 undergraduates to develop this idea further on our ternary blend systems. We ambitiously aim to develop high performance photovoltaic devices, which necessitate no high-temperature treatment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn my graduate studies, I wish to deepen my knowledge in materials and solid-state devices. Light emitting diodes, photovoltaic, and transistors are of my special interests. Carnegie Mellon University with its centres such as CNXT and CEIC has excelled in the development of these fields. Other areas that I am also interested in are photonics, biosensors, fuel cells, and other energy-related works. In short, my background and field of interest will match best with the works of Prof Lisa Porter, Prof Elias Towe, Prof Paul Salvador, and Prof Jay Whitacre at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI trust that PhD in MSE at Carnegie Mellon University would be the best career path for my ambition to be a scientist. Upon graduation, I will be well prepared for professorship position, work at research institution, and many other possibilities. In whichever routes I eventually embark on, I will strive to give my all to the betterment of the society.\n\n##########\n\n<strong><em><u>Word Counts: 879</u></em></strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><strong><u>Statement of Purpose – Side by Side Comparison</u></strong></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you are applying to graduate schools, one part of the application package that will consume a lot of your time is Statement of Purpose (SOP). SOP is required for college application to most USA graduate schools. In this SOP, the applicant can write anything she wants, ranging from her background, accomplishments, hobbies, extracurricular, her passions and dreams, or obstacles she overcame in the past. One has a complete freedom to craft her SOP and can choose the writing style, choice of words, or things to write about. The main purpose of SOP is basically to relay one single message to the admission committee; that you are the perfect candidate that they are looking for!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile other components of the application package are pretty much “standardized” (e.g. degree transcript, TOEFL, GRE) and do not show the human side of the applicants, SOP provides them an opportunity to show their uniqueness and convince the admission committees that they are a great fit for the school/program. With this SOP, an applicant who does not have the perfect scorecards can use her creative persuasion and imaginative writing skills to induce emotions on the audience, eventually securing her admission to her dream school. If you research on the SOPs that get the applicants offers from top schools, you would find some common denominators. This aims to do just that; to give you some useful tips that you can use when you write your own SOP.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTake some time to read the two sample SOPs from the same candidate. SOP 1 is the candidate\'s very first draft, and SOP 2 is his final version (e.g. after multiple touch-ups and was eventually submitted to the application system). Read carefully and imagine yourself as a professor in the admission committee at a top school, sitting in a desk with many tall piles of application packages from thousands of hopeful applicants. Which SOP do you like better? Why do you like that one better? After you are done reviewing these two SOPs, read on below. We will break it down and share with you why SOP 2 will give the candidate a better chance of leaving a strong impression on the admission committee.\n<ol>\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong><u>Article Length</u></strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nNotice that SOP 1 has 1386 words, while SOP 2 has only 879 words. SOP 1 is very wordy and takes much longer time (e.g. almost twice) to read and digest. SOP 2 on the other hand, feels more “straight-to-the-point” and more catchy. Although SOP 1 has many more details and substance, it is far from succinct and concise. When you are bombarded by so much information in a single article, would you remember everything in it?\n\nMany applicants have plenty of accomplishments and interesting things about themselves to share. And naturally, they would try to squeeze everything in their SOP hoping that the admission committees know how accomplished they are. They are likely to write something similar to SOP 1. This will actually backfire because the super long SOP 1 is now too long, unfocused, incoherent, and even worse; boring. Notice how many extra details SOP 1 has and how long the first paragraph is. The first paragraph does not even mention anything related to the candidate! Even worse is paragraph 3 and 4. They are so long and flooded with plenty of technical jargons, which will just lose the readers instead of engaging them. In short, SOP 1 is too long and too highly technical.\n\nOur advice #1 here is to keep your SOP simple and flashy. Mention only few of your TOP accomplishments, as what we have in SOP 2. You can exclude smaller accomplishments, especially those that are pretty insignificant and occurred long ago (e.g. 1<sup>st</sup> rank in class in elementary school). Focus on accomplishments that were built on top of each other (e.g. they are related). This way, you can stitch them together, resulting in an SOP that reads more like a story with a nice obvious flow.\n\nAlso, mention something memorable and unique about you early on in the SOP without being long winded. In the short first paragraph, SOP 2 mentions the meaning of the candidate\'s unique name, the fact that he excelled in high school and won a national science medal. This is all in a single paragraph! Compare this to SOP 1, which takes the first 2 paragraphs to “warm up” before entering the main part of the story. It can be something creative that you did in high school, a difficult obstacle that you overcame in your life, or big event in your life that really shapes you. You need to get the readers hooked quickly. Admission committees have to read thousands of SOPs and they will find most SOPs to appear the same after a while. Use your creativity to stamp the memory of you in the readers\' head within the first few seconds.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong><u>Details and Specifics</u></strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nWhile one should avoid using generalities in writing SOP, overindulging in details and specifics are not advantageous too. SOP 1 has numerous, mostly unrelated, details. They are not coherent and are frequently described using technical jargons. You can find this problem in paragraph 3 and 4. These two paragraphs are long-winded and very difficult to digest. It takes a tremendous effort to read and really understand all the intricate details in these two paragraphs. All the technicalities mentioned here are very specific to organic electronics field and people outside of the field would have a hard time trying to understand what is being written in these two paragraphs.\n\nNow, take a look at paragraph 2 and 3 of SOP 2. In these two short paragraphs, the candidate brought up the fact that; 1) he proactively looks for research opportunities outside of class, 2) he got a near perfect GPA, 3) he got a 1<sup>st</sup> class honors, 4) he joins a research group, 5) he publishes his first paper! These accomplishments are NOT his main/best accomplishments. However, the candidate flashes them quickly to build an impression of him being a high achieving student early on in the SOP.&nbsp; Notice how the two paragraphs are succinct and brief. By craftily showcasing his accomplishments in these two paragraphs, the candidate effectively gets the audience awed and keeps them interested to know more about him.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong><u>Climax</u></strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nGreat SOPs are ones that read like a superhero\'s story. It starts with some background and unique things about the superhero when he was little. The story then tells the audience some talents that the superhero starts to show when he is younger. As the superhero grows older, he polishes his talents and achieves even greater strength. People start realizing how great he is. The story eventually climaxes when the superhero beats his archenemy using his superpower and supertalent. Now, in your SOP, you are the superhero and your GREATEST accomplishment is the story\'s climax.\n\nThere is some flow in paragraph 3 and 4 in SOP 1. However, since these paragraphs are very long, they “feel” flat and lack any climax. The candidate basically shares his accomplishments and what he did in his research. He also shows how one thing leads to another. However, it is hard to tell which accomplishment is his greatest. All the accomplishments the candidate mentions feel like they are all not that significant. Paragraph 3 and 4 in SOP 1 are great example of a candidate trying to cramp all his past accomplishments but fails to create a climax in his story.\n\nSOP 2 is written with a different style. The presence of the flow is very obvious in paragraph 2 through paragraph 6. The events are told chronologically and the story follows the candidate from earlier to latter stage of his undergraduate life. The candidate\'s accomplishments are mentioned rapidly and they of <u>ascending</u> magnitude (e. g. maintained high GPA à joined a research group à published his first paper à join another group à built lab from scratch à presented finding in an international conference à made breakthrough improvement à in process of publishing second paper!). Building the momentum from paragraph 2 through paragraph 5, the story culminates when the candidate overcomes a difficult task in paragraph 6. This is the story\'s climax. When you read SOP 2 and read this part of the article, you can feel that the candidate is on top of the world.\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong><u>Get rid of the cliché </u></strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nSOP is an article where you can share anything about you that makes you a strong candidate for the school/program. It is advisable to minimize the amount of information in the SOP that is not directly related to you. Also, avoid generalities and big words such as “…making the world a better place...” or “…improve people\'s lives..”. These are things that ANY candidate can say. Having these words in your SOP does not make you unique at all. Thousands of other candidates are very likely writing the same thing. You can find many of these types of big words in the first and last paragraph of SOP 1.\n\nOur advice #4 for you here is to use simple yet specific terms. Notice how the first paragraph of SOP 2 is simple and succinct. It gives a great introduction of the candidates. On the other hand, the first paragraph of SOP 1 is just plain boring and does not say anything about the candidate or more importantly, his accomplishments. Now, go on and read the last paragraph of SOP 2. In there, you can find specific plans that the candidate has after his graduation from the graduate program (e.g. industry, professorship, or scientist). It is straight to the point. This is far better than the last paragraph of SOP 1 where the candidate has some sentences which are unnecessary and do not contain enough specifics (e.g. “I would like to be the agent who brings sciences from laboratories to useful applications that improve people\'s quality of life.”).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere you have it. Re-read and re-review these two sample SOPs. Figure out which components make one better than the other. Additionally, you can also find a number of great SOPs on the web, especially those that result in offers from top schools/programs. Read as many as you can and get some inspiration from them for your own SOP. Once you are done with your first draft, ask your friends to review it and do some touch-ups after getting their feedbacks. Repeat this process, preferably with different sets of friends, multiple times. The whole process will take some time but if you iterate many times enough, your final SOP will be sure to impress and leave a lasting impression on the admission committees.\n\n[contact-form][contact-field label=\'Name\' type=\'name\' required=\'1\'/][contact-field label=\'Email\' type=\'email\' required=\'1\'/][contact-field label=\'Comment\' type=\'textarea\' required=\'1\'/][/contact-form]', 'story.jpeg', 'Statement of Purpose (SOP): Comparison', 'publish', 'Here we have comparison of two different statement of purposes', 'SOP', 'Here we have side-by-side comparison of two different statement of purposes.

If you think that the US has the best education system in the world – think again. America, together with the UK and Australia have consistently considered as the most attractive study destinations thanks to plenty of top universities that they host. However, their education systems are still considered lagging behind one Scandinavian country: Finland.\n\nWhat is the first thing that comes to your mind when we mention Finland? Moose? Eternal snow? Well, it is more than just long-lasting chills or furry animals or high standard of living. In the past decade, it is crowned as the most literate country. Over 98% of its population are able to read and have access to higher education. It is also improving its math and science literacy significantly.\n\nHoward Gardner, a professor of education from Harvard University, once advised that the Americans should learn from the Finnish: they have the most effective education system. <strong>Effective</strong>, that is the keyword.\n<h2>Several analyses have unveiled the reasons to why students in Finland excel far better than those from other countries.</h2>\nFirst, children do not receive formal education (school) until the age 7. This allows children to enjoy their childhood completely, instead of struggling with how to memorize the alphabets or perform basic maths like most children do in other country. It creates a “stress-free” environment which boosts children\'s ability to absorb new knowledge.\n\nSchool regulations are also designed to foster this environment. School mandates 15 minutes break every hour of study, every day. Outdoor activities such as field trips or games are also part of the teaching method. These options have created such comfortable environments. Students do not feel like they are merely studying, but also having fun in the process.\n\nSecond is the evaluation method. Students are not accessed by paper-based test like in most schools in other countries. Their acknowledgement is monitored and evaluated based on their daily performance in classes or other study activities. This is another reason why teachers play vital role in Finland\'s education. They act as the \'accommodator\' of knowledge, not the sole source of knowledge. It is not an easy job to become a teacher in Finland – only the top 10% of national graduates with Master degree can apply as a teacher.\n\nThe same methods are also applied in their higher education system, such as in universities. Students are encouraged to look for practical solutions. Finland boldly supports equality in education. This is why you would not find rankings, standardized-exams or comparisons between students in this country. Everything is personally evaluated. If you struggle to keep up, you are welcome to ask for assistance from your teacher. If one method failed, the teacher will consult with his / her colleagues, and design another method that may work. Students are the center of Finland\'s education system, not the education itself.\n<h3>Finland has put a lot of hard-work to reach this great result. Their methods may not be suitable for other countries, but one thing that we can learn from Finland is that education is supposed to be enjoyable, not stressful. Study should be engaging and enlightening.</h3>', 'finland.jpg', 'Why Finland Is Said to Have the Best Education System?', 'publish', '', 'education', 'Americans should learn from the Finnish: they have the most effective education system.

This time we are going to discuss business and management. This course has continuously become popular among students due to its practicality.\n<ol>\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong>Broad area</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nBusiness and management is a very versatile course. The course has a variety of subjects to choose from and cover a wide range of real world application from banking to entrepreneurship. That means student can easily find subject that matches specific interest. It pretty much caters for everyone.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong>Promising prospects</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nIts broad area of study selections thus gives flexibility for business and management\'s graduates to work in various sectors. It is relatively easier for its graduates to move around industry sectors as business and management are applicable everywhere. The skill sets acquired are highly transferable across industries.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong>Balance between practical and theoretical approach</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nUnlike other courses such as design which is very practical or language, which is very theoretical, business and management combine these two aspects. The business and management course emphasizes the importance of application of theoretical solution to real-world cases.\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong>Dual Degree</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nGenerally business schools allow their students to combine two degrees: one that is related to business and the other that is related to the student\'s personal interest. For example, if you are also interested in communication, you can take that degree while still pursuing your business degree. This idea gives student opportunity to explore their second interest while completing their business degree.\n<ol start=\"5\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong>Global Acceptance</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nBusiness and management course has quite similar and well-known structure worldwide. Unlike law for example – it is territory based since each country has its own law or anthropology which has strong ties with locality. Business and management is universal. This means no matter where you study the subject, it gives you the same set of knowledge and skills.\n\nBusiness and management is a very promising course to study. Some people consider this course as “common”. It enables you to apply your knowledge in almost every work sectors. In fact, The Complete University Guide UK has ranked this course as one of the most popular study degree, thanks to lots of benefits it has.\n<h4>Whether you have made up your mind about your course of study, it is wise to always important to consider your choice carefully.

With limited facilities and accommodation, it often pushes most students to pursue this subject abroad. To help you make your decision, we have compiled some reasons to why you should consider studying medical science.\n<h3><strong>Medical Science makes real impacts on our lives</strong></h3>\nThis is one of the subjects that has direct and real impacts on life: medical science put human-beings at its core. However, it is also one of the most challenging subjects to study. If you have strong empathy towards others, excel in math and science, and are passionate about improving our quality of healthcare services, this is the right option for you.\n<h3><strong>Study medical science means continuously evolving</strong></h3>\nSince medical science primarily studies human-beings that are highly dynamic, this subject continuously evolves. We can see it in our daily lives; in the last decades, some new diseases have emerged and medical science stands at the edge to provide solutions. These challenges will never stop and they push medical science, along with other subjects, to come up with the answers. If you are curious and thirst for knowledge, medical science will never bore you.\n<h3><strong>Uniformity</strong></h3>\nSimilar to Business and Management, medical science is a universal subject, providing its graduates the flexibility of work. Whether you are graduated in the US or Europe, you can treat patients in Asia or Africa. There is a standardization in treatments and procedures but generally, this subject is well-accepted in every part of the world.\n<h3><strong>It encourages teamwork</strong></h3>\nMost professions in medical-related fields require not only excellent knowledge but also teamwork skills. Cooperation is a must and in most cases, it is nearly impossible to work alone. You will learn how to communicate with others, how to value your colleagues, how to make an urgent decision and how to transfer your knowledge and skills. If you are a lone wolf who prefers to do everything alone, this may not be the most suitable option for you.\n<h3><strong>There are plenty of good job opportunities</strong></h3>\nAfter you graduate, it is unlikely that you do not get a job. In fact, statistics worldwide have shown that we always need more doctors and medical practitioners. You can always work in hospitals, open your own clinic or take further specialization such as gynecologist or pediatricians. Going into this field could guarantee you not only a job&nbsp;but also a career.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDespite lots of benefits that it offers, most students find that medical science is not an easy subject. It studies human-beings, the most complex life forms ever existed. However, if you put your positive thinking hat, you will see that it is a very promising field and worth-pursuing.

Design is a vast field which covers various specializations from fashion, graphic to industrial design. In most universities, these courses are grouped together within the same faculty - sometimes along with architecture. As technology advances, many new design-related specializations have emerged, such as user interface design, mobile application design, game design and environmental design.\n<ol>\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> Drawing skill: Should I have it?</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nThis could be the biggest nightmare for design-course applicants. Having a prior drawing skill is not essentially necessary. It could be a great help but that\'s about it. Depending on your specialization, not <em>all</em> design-course require an adequate drawing skill. In the early semesters of design study, students will be taught how to draw. Figure drawing will be taught for fashion students or technical drawing for industrial design students.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>\n<h3>I am color-blind. Can I enroll for a design course?</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nAs colors play vital roles in design process, being a color-blind could be very challenging for you while studying design. Most design course require color-blind test for their applicants - however, this policy may be different, depending on the specialization. Ensure to check the program requirements first before you apply.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> Will I need a Macbook?</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nMacbook computers have been long associated with designers. And yes, they could be intimidating if you don\'t have one. However, computer is only a tool of creation for designers. In the 1900s when computers had not been invented, design pioneers did everything manually by hand - which in return, enhanced their handcraft abilities. A computer with adequate specifications to support design software such as the Adobes would be fine. It could be any brand as long as it works for you. Try to avoid using the hardcore, ultra-expensive computers as you may need to work using \"standard\" tools or even under-qualified ones at your workplace.\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> I want to study this particular design course. Which one is the best design school that offer such course?</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nIt is quite difficult to nominate top design schools amongst others as designers would mainly be judged based on their portfolio, abilities and experience instead of their alumnus. There are some good design schools such as Parsons, School of Visual Arts (SVA) or Savannah College of The Art (SCAD). Instead of looking for he \"best\" one, you should pick a design course that you can afford. The course should allow you to create as many qualified artworks as possible for your portfolio.\n<ol start=\"5\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> I could not find a design course that suits my interest</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nSome design courses may be named differently across universities. User Interaction Design may also be known as Interaction Design, Interactive Design, Interactive Technology Communication, Mobile Application Design or Human-Computer Interaction. Some courses could also be <strong>not found </strong>under arts and design faculty. Instead, they may be put under Faculty of Information Technology or Computer Science. Even if a university has a design faculty, it may not offer <em><strong>all</strong> </em>design courses. In fact, most generally provide two to four specialized design courses. Use key words and read the course curriculum to find the right course for you instead of using the full title—less specific is better in this case.\n<ol start=\"6\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> Is design a promising field?</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nWhat you need to know before attending design school is that designers are valued based on their <strong>skills</strong> and <strong>experience</strong>. Most design job opportunities require a portfolio showcase or a certain years of design-job experience. The focus of your study should be to learn as much design skills as possible and establish a <strong>legit portfolio</strong>. Some great designers did not attend design school, but managed to get high-paid job and top-notch clienteles thanks to their engaging portfolio and years of design experience.', 'Design.png', 'Frequently Asked Questions: Design Course', 'publish', '', 'design course', 'In this article, we will address some questions that we have received regarding Design course.

In Australia, for example, semester one will soon start at the end of February.&nbsp;</em>\n\n<em>As we have always mentioned in our previous articles, preparation is the key! Before you go, we have prepared this 3-part article series that will discuss important details to make the move as easy as possible for you. Make sure to check them out!</em>\n<ol>\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> The Paperwork</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nGetting all your paperwork done could be one of the most painstaking part in your pre-departure preparation. Before you leave, ensure that you have all the documents ready. These include student visa, passport, academic records (with their <strong>certified</strong> English translations) and medical insurance. Check the dates on the documents and verify your ID carefully. Look for any mistakes. Inform the university or related institution as soon as you find one, so they can be fixed in time. Have several copies of these documents and put them in two different folders: one folder for you to keep and the other to be shown to the authorities.&nbsp; Again, make sure all the legal documents are <strong>legally&nbsp;</strong><strong>certified</strong> copies, especially those translated copies. This will save you from troubles later on. If you are still classified as a minor, make sure that you have legal permission to travel alone.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> The Money</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nWhether you are self-funded or sponsored, always bring some cash with you during your first visit. Try to diversify them in various values, such as USD 100, 50 and 20. You might need the small denominations to pay for bus tickets or taxis from the airport to your accommodation. Some universities have free airport pick-up service, check your university website for its availability. If you have credit cards, make sure that they are under your name and can be used overseas. Some countries have difficulties in processing bank cheques, so it is always a good idea to have cash. Check the immigration website to ensure how much cash you can bring without having to declare it to customs. Otherwise, you risking of getting into trouble. Some countries such as Australia require that you report to the authorities if you bring over AUD 10,000 cash.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> The Place:&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nFinding proper accommodation with reasonable price is another gruelling task to go through. Do not panic, you can always ask help from the local Persatuan Pelajar Indonesia (PPI) available globally, property agents or local community selling websites such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://flatmates.com.au/melbourne?gclid=CjwKCAiA693RBRAwEiwALCc3u6A8-FM9D8y-sPAKYNpASOL27qQKzkd7tgoK5g8fF_Pet8TWVJ6N-xoC0VsQAvD_BwE\"><em>Flatmates&nbsp;</em></a>in Australia. We highly recommend you to inspect the place before sealing the deal. Inquire about the bonds required, what are included in the rental cost, whether it includes the bills or not.&nbsp;We can\'t stress the importance of having a contract, especially if you are staying with someone you don\'t know well. Make sure you read through everything before you sign the contract, as it\'s a legally-binding document.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRemember that your safety abroad is paramount. Don\'t stay somewhere or with someone that your gut feelings telling you not to. If you could not find a permanent accommodation yet, you can always try a temporary one. You can contact students who plan to go on vacation during the given period or about to finish their studies. Campuses also would have a forum or a noticeboard where students can post ads for accommodations. Another easier option is of course to stay on campus, there are a lot of students housing option on campus available. Normally there are also a lot of student accommodation complexes available surrounding the university or nearby. Just email the international admission office of your university to assist you if required.\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li>\n<h3>The Clothing</h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nPacking the right essentials could always easily turn into a nightmare itself. What should you pack? Once again, you need to check the current season in the country you will be studying. Find out how generally people dress over there for the seasons. Utilize&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.google.com\"><em>Google</em> </a>to assist your preparation. <em>Google&nbsp;</em>can give you plenty of helpful information about the weather and the local temperature. With this information, you can be sure that you pack adequately. We suggest you to pack some easy-to-mix-and-match clothing items, those that you can layer up easily for chillier weather. Remember to always pack at least a good and reliable jacket. You don\'t need to worry too much if you did forget something, thanks to the ease of online shopping and the rise of affordable modern clothing shops.\n<ol start=\"5\">\n 	<li>\n<h3><strong> The Flight</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\nJust like other trips, you need to consider the duration of your flights, especially if you are taking multiple flights and transiting in some countries. Watch the transit time carefully. Avoid long transits. You might need a place to rest if you are stopping over for more than 12 hours and you will need to take your luggage with you. On the other hand, we also recommend you to avoid super short transits–one hour or less between flights. Murphy\'s Law states that <em>anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.&nbsp;</em>If one of your flights get delayed, you wouldn\'t want to miss out on all your other legs of flight. Make sure you allow adequate transit time between your flights. If there\'s a direct flight, that\'d be the best choice.\n\n&nbsp;', '•-Studying-abroad-•.png', 'Studying Abroad: What to Prepare', 'publish', 'Studying Abroad: What to Prepare', 'studying abroad', 'This is a three-part article series on studying abroad.

In this article, we are going to discuss what items to put in your travel bag to help you pack wisely.\n\nAirlines have different luggage policy. We advise that you confirm it with your respective airlines (go to their website). Some airlines such as Garuda Indonesia, offers a maximum of 40 kg of luggage for students – a real generous weight that is nearly double the standard luggage weight for international flights.\n\nOkay, now let\'s begin.\n<ol>\n 	<li><strong> Proper clothes</strong></li>\n</ol>\nAs we mentioned in the first article, you need to check the current season in the country you are heading to so that you pack proper clothing. By proper we mean those you are going to <em>practically</em> wear, not what you <em>think </em>you are going to wear. You do not need to pack your entire wardrobe to your travel bags. Pick neutral clothes that can be used for various occasions such as plain white shirts and jeans. Use vacuum bags to save space in your luggage. Do not forget to bring batik shirt for formal ceremonies in the local Indonesian embassy. If you are a business major student, you might also need a suit.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li><strong> Shoes</strong></li>\n</ol>\nSneakers, formal shoes or boots? It seems that you might need all three of them, but there is always a solution that covers them all. Men can try safety / adventure shoes: they are comfortable, waterproof and look quite presentable, which means that you can use this type of shoe for almost all occasions. Women can try sneakers or flat shoes; it is unlikely that you are going to attend a cocktail party everyday so better leave those collections of high-heels at home.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li><strong> Toiletries</strong></li>\n</ol>\nShampoo, soaps, toothbrush, toothpaste, razors, brush, combs, deodorant and any other cosmetic products – prepare one month of supplies and pack them into zip bags. You also need nail clippers, tissues, clean towels, hairdryers (optional) and over-the-counter medicines such as aspirins for fever or colds. You could take herbal medicines too, but some countries have strict policies about such medicines. It is better to check the rules on the immigration website first.\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li><strong> Electronic supports</strong></li>\n</ol>\nDid you know that each country have different types of power outlets? Although it may sound trivial, it could be annoying if you do not anticipate it well (imagine that you are unable to charge your dying phone after hours of long flight simply because it cannot be connected to the power outlet!) The solution is to bring a universal travel adaptor – you can easily buy one from local electronic store with reasonable price. These adaptors have various modes and you can adjust them to your local power outlets easily.\n<ol start=\"5\">\n 	<li><strong> (Memorabilia</strong><strong>?)</strong></li>\n</ol>\nPhotos of your family, friends, or even your pets could be an effective medicine for homesickness. Slip some photos of your loved ones in your laptop bag or notebook.

To check the previous articles you can click <strong><em>here </em></strong>and<strong><em> here</em></strong><strong><em>. </em></strong>\n\nConsidering you have arrived in your country destination safe and sound, the next thing to think about is what to do next. As a foreigner in an unfamiliar place, it is important to do these things during the first week upon your arrival.\n<ol>\n 	<li><strong> Inform your host university</strong></li>\n</ol>\nMost universities have Enrolment Day a couple days prior to orientation period in which enrolled students are required to re-register themselves. You need to bring several documents such as your Student Visa and Letter of Acceptance for Enrolment Day. Each major and faculty may have different dates for Enrolment Day so you need to check your university website. After that, you will receive your student ID which verifies that you are now officially a student of your host university.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li><strong> Report to your local Indonesia embassy / consulate</strong></li>\n</ol>\nMost Indonesian students who study abroad underestimate the importance of informing the Indonesian embassy (KBRI) about your presence in that foreign country. KBRI would be the only Indonesian authority that can help you when you have legal issues, accidents, etc.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li><strong> Join student organizations</strong></li>\n</ol>\nTry to join some student organizations in your university. It helps you to expand your interests, establish new contacts, and improve foreign language skills. Do not forget to contact the local PPI or any Indonesia-related organizations in your host university. It is always nice to have some friends who could also understand Bahasa.\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li><strong> Open local bank accounts</strong></li>\n</ol>\nYou may be surprised that money transactions in your host country mostly do not require cash anymore – most advanced countries have become nearly \"cashless\". Thus, you need to open local bank accounts to save your money and use the debit or credit cards for your daily transactions. Choosing international banks such as HSBC, Citibank, Commonwealth Bank or ANZ which also have branches in Indonesia can make cross-country money transfer easier. <strong>5. Get your local mobile number</strong>\n\nThis is one of the most important things to do as soon as you arrive. You want to inform your family that you have arrived. Chances are you will need internet data in your phone to navigate the foreign country as well. Mostly, every country has various mobile operators. Do some research or ask your local friends to pick the one with the best offer. Things to consider include the limit of internet data, international calls, network coverage, and price.\n<ol start=\"6\">\n 	<li><strong> Memorize places</strong></li>\n</ol>\nTake time to memorize places such as classrooms, cafeteria, libraries, parking lots, department stores, shops or any other place that you may visit frequently. Pick a city map (available for free on tourist desk at the airport) and learn the routes and which public transportations you would need to visit such places. After you have reliable internet connection, you can always use Google Maps. Once you have them in your mind, it will save your time.\n<ol start=\"7\">\n 	<li><strong> Visit the library</strong></li>\n</ol>\nOnce you are enrolled and have a student ID, you will have access to your university portal where you can find detailed information about your classes including the reference books you need to borrow from the library.\n\nThis series of articles cover most of the important things you need to know about starting your journey abroad.

We hope you had a great time during the end of the year\'s holiday. To start this New Year, we are sharing some new year celebrations from all around the world. It is indeed the right time to celebrate, but do you know that in Denmark, people welcome the New Year by shattering dishes in front of their neighbours\' doors gleefully? Keep reading on!\n<ol>\n 	<li>\n<h2>England</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\nAs today\'s role-model for a modern country, it is funny that the Brits still believe in luck-bearers. They have certain traits for the very first guest to walk into their doors in the New Year; he has to be tall, young, dark-haired male, preferably with some gifts. They believe this guest will bring them luck.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>\n<h2>China</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\nIn the culture-rich country like China, New Year is all about prosperity and happiness. Red is the colour that the Chinese believes symbolizes happiness, good luck and wealth and that is why in the New Year, everything is decorated in red, from clothes to front doors.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li>\n<h2>Spain</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\nCelebrations are incomplete without festive foods and the Spanish people know it. To welcome the New Year, people in Spain compete in speed-eating challenge. For good luck, the Spanish are required to eat 12 grapes when the clock strikes midnight on New Year\'s Eve – one for each clock chime.\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li>\n<h2>France</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\nSpanish are not the only ones who share good food on New Year. Their neighbour, the French, prepare their bellies for series of feasts from <em>foie gras, </em>turkey, oysters, pancakes and on the top of them, good champagne.\n<ol start=\"5\">\n 	<li>\n<h2>Russia</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\nAs the country that is commonly believed to be the homeland of Santa Claus (or Father Frost, as what the Russians call him), Christmas and New Year are both celebrated with family feasts and plenty of kids for both kids and adults.\n<ol start=\"6\">\n 	<li>\n<h2>Italy</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\nLike Russians, the Italians consider their New Year gifts very seriously as they symbolize something that the giver wish for the receiver. For example, to wish for good wealth, you can wrap up gold, honey or simply some cash as your gift.\n<ol start=\"7\">\n 	<li>\n<h2>Switzerland and Puerto Rico</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\nSmashing or throwing things is not exclusively for the Danish. In Switzerland, people drop ice creams deliberately on the floor to celebrate Christmas while the Puerto Ricans gladly throw a bucket of water out of their windows as a sign to toss away evil spirits.\n<ol start=\"8\">\n 	<li>\n<h2>Belgium and Romania</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\nThe Belgians believe that Christmas is not only for human. On New Year\'s Eve, they shake the hands of their beloved ones and wish their cows a happy new year. In Romania, the farmers will try to chat with the cows. If the animal responds, that means good luck in the New Year.\n<ol start=\"9\">\n 	<li>\n<h2>Philippines</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\nOur neighbour in the north are going into round-frenzy during New Year time. They believe that round things symbolize wealth, so they wear something with round design from polka dot clothes, coins and round foods.\n<ol start=\"10\">\n 	<li>\n<h2>Vietnam</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\nNew Year is commonly associated as the momentum of change: from old to new and it is the spirit that Vietnamese believe in. During the celebration, people in Vietnam wear new clothes to symbolize a new beginning.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, which one is your favourite? Do you have your own unique tradition? In Indonesia, we share some of these traditions, such as exchanging gifts with family and colleagues to wish good luck in the New Year or wearing new things to mark the new beginning. We hope that in this New Year, you are encouraged to set up new goals, for instance, going abroad to study.

Be it IGCSE to enter a preparatory college or <strong>AS</strong> /&nbsp;<strong>A Levels</strong>, all exam candidates need preparation. In this blog series, we will be discussing&nbsp;<strong>A Level</strong> examination in the subject areas of Mathematics, Physics and Accounting. Having once felt the pressure of taking the <strong>A Level</strong> exam yet able to ace it with flying colors, we are going to share tips for each <strong>A Level</strong> subject area individually.\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>A-Level Exam Subject: Mathematics</h2>\nBeing a subject almost everyone will take, it is not easy to predict the type of questions that will come out on the <strong>A Level</strong>&nbsp;exam. Questions are crafted carefully to be neither too easy nor too difficult for high entry candidates. The bright side is, you don\'t have to worry. There are some tricks to help get you prepared for the questions.\n<ol>\n 	<li>Check out the most up-to-date syllabus and Learner Guide for your <strong>A-Level</strong> exam series. You can get them&nbsp; from CIE\'s official website. Make sure to cover all the topics as you study and revise before the exam. Prepare for all possibilities, you never know what can come out.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>Practice past papers. This is a very effective method to ace the <strong>A-Level</strong> exam. Every time doing it, set yourself as if in an examination with a timer on. Refrain from opening up a textbook or notes when answering the questions to test yourself for the real exam. As cliché as it may sound, do learn from the mistakes during practice so you don\'t repeat the same mistake in the real exam.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"3\">\n 	<li>Try to sort the questions into the different topics mentioned in the syllabus. Put in the score percentage you got correct for each topic. Draw up a table and do it for all the past papers. From there, analyze which topics you got mostly correct and those that still need improvement. For the next practice, focus on the topics you\'re still relatively weaker on. In addition to that, look at topics mentioned on the&nbsp;syllabus that you\'ve never encountered with. Chances are, the topics have never been tested on previous exams. Always be proactive and look up for sample questions online or in textbooks.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"4\">\n 	<li>For those of you aiming for high score, knowledge of the subject alone may not always be enough. Losing even just small points may make you fall into a lower band for borderline cases, especially when the grade threshold is high for the particular series you are taking. So what should one do? Be familiar with the correct format of answering the different papers you will be taking.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Important notes</h2>\n<strong>- For Pure Mathematics</strong> (Paper 1 and 3), make sure to write all workings, not just the final answer. Especially for questions with bigger points (usually the last few questions), you may lose points for every missing work line. Make sure to write your workings concisely and neatly. Not to forget, even when you cannot find the final answer or in case it turns out to be wrong, points may still be gained for the workings you\'ve written.\n\n<strong>- For those of you taking Mechanics</strong> (Paper 4 and 5), make sure you read the question word after word when interpreting it into diagrams. Pay attention to negative signs for vectors.\n\n<strong>- As for Statistics</strong> (Paper 6 and 7), always cross-check your answer with the question. This is important for questions with long arithmetical workings. An example is to calculate the <strong>standard deviation</strong> of more than 10 data. Here, there\'s a possibility to finish work at its <strong>variance</strong> – when you actually still need to square root it to get the standard deviation. A careless mistake like this may cost you marks when there is a point for the process of square-rooting and another mark for accuracy (arriving at the exact final answer as that shown on the marking scheme).\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Last but not least about A-Level Exam...</h2>\nWe would like to emphasize the importance of being familiar to the aspects of the <strong>A-Level</strong> examination, be it the content of the subject itself, question types, method of answering the questions and what the examiner\'s looking after in the answers. You will be given a formula booklet MF9 along with you question paper and answer booklets. When you have time, get familiar to the formulas included in the booklet.\n\nFor example, when you need to use the multiplication of two trigonometric functions but forgot the basic addition formula during the exam, simply derive it from the addition formula given in the booklet. Saves precious time to recall the formula by writing it on the rough working paper. And for those of you taking Statistics, do get used to the normal distribution table attached to the MF9 booklet.

His presidential term has been characterized by actions and order aligned to his slogan “Make America Great Again”. The figure is taken from hotspotsmagazine.com.[/caption]\n\n<strong>Donald Trump\'s election to the White House has certainly caught many people by surprise. For a lot of international students who are planning to pursue an education or career in the US, many might be wondering—how, if at all, does Trump\'s election affect their lives? In this article, contributor Mike Kurniawan shares some insights on how the Trump Era affects international students.</strong>\n\nSince decades ago, the United States (US) has been one of the top destinations for students, scholars and researchers from all around the world. Despite the steadily rising tuition fee across the nation, American universities have seen an ever-increasing number of applicants in the last few decades. Under the Trump Era, many regulations with direct impact on student life, such as immigration and tax reform, have been updated. This article touches on few key topics that may impact international students\' decision whether to embark on their academic journey in the US.\n\n<b>1</b>) <b>Immigration </b><b>and International Travel</b>\n\nApplying for student visa, work visa, length of stay, and success rate of the applications are among the uncertainties that keep international students on their toes. Under the Trump administration, the F-1 and J-1 student visas are mostly unchanged. Keep in mind that F-1 visa allows you to work for 1 year after graduation on a program called OPT (Optional Practical Training) and those F-1 visa holders in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) field get an optional 2 years of extension, commonly known as STEM OPT.\n\nWork visas and permanent residency, on the other hand, are topics that are heavily debated. Among US work visas, H-1B is the most popular route as it allows holders to work for 3 years with another 3 years of extension upon approval. In 2017, the quota for H-1B recipients stayed the same at 85,000. There were reports about petitions being more closely scrutinized (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-tightens-scrutiny-of-skilled-worker-visa-applicants-1511114338\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.path2usa.com/blog/an-increase-in-request-for-evidence-delaying-h1b-visa-processing\">here</a>) and USCIS officers requesting for more supporting documents. The 3 years of extension was also rumored to be planned for obsoletion (<a href=\"http://www.firstpost.com/world/h1b-extensions-on-the-chopping-block-4282721.html\">here</a>). News about a new H-1B law requiring applicants to fill positions paying some six-digit salary or above were circulating in the media in the earlier part of the year as well. And lastly, there were some talks about eliminating the ability of H-4 holders (i.e. dependent) to be employed. All of the above, however, have not been officially passed/approved.\n\nThe same higher level of scrutiny has also been reported for green card applications. Applicants are put at higher standards and must be able to prove their strong background, track record, and show clear benefits that they can bring to the US. More spotlights are given to the lottery-based green cards, which make up about 5% of the total granted US permanent residencies. Some have challenged this route to the US permanent residency and proposed to completely eliminate it. Up to the time of this writing, however, the proposal has not been made official. All in all, the pressure for updates and tightening of H-1B and US permanent residency may result in greater difficulty and competition among international students and job seekers in the job market.\n\n<b>2) </b><b>Tax Laws</b>\n\nIf you followed the news from last 2017, there were many articles about the tax cut proposed by President Trump. The idea of passing a tax cut reform is to allow people and corporations to keep more of their income and use it to grow the economy through higher spending and higher investment. The tax reform has been recently passed and is finally a reality. The economic impact of this new tax law, however, is still to be seen.\n\nThere was a proposal to make the graduate students\' waived tuition fees taxable. Graduate students in the US are normally paid about $15,000 – $30,000 annually, and they perform research and teach undergraduate classes. In return, the universities waive their tuition fees, which range from $40,000 – $50,000. If these graduate students have to pay tax on their waived tuition fees, it will be a big hit to their already small stipend. Some experts estimated that the additional tax owed by the graduate students, should this proposal pass, would be in the range of $2,000 – $3,500 per year. This translates to a lower income of between $167 – $292 per month, which is substantial compared to the average stipend of around $2,000 – $3,000 per month. Though this law did not pass, some graduate students in American universities are still uneasy as they feel that the government may pursue this proposal again in the near future (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/us/politics/graduate-students-education-tax-bill.html\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/15/pf/college/grad-students-tuition-waiver/index.html\">here</a>).\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2607\" src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2018/03/Figure-2a.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"932\" height=\"646\" />\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2608\" src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2018/03/Figure-2b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"930\" height=\"643\" />\n\nThe tables above show the 2017 and 2018 US income tax brackets, for singles and married filers. In a glance, one can see that the new tax laws lower the amount of tax owed by taxpayers. The goal of this, along with corporate tax cuts, is to grow the US economy through higher consumer spending, entrepreneurship, and more corporate hiring. Figure was taken from Business Insider.\n\n<b>3) </b><b>Rent and Housing</b>\n\nUnder Trump Era, the housing/property market has also been impacted. While the new law for a lower limit for tax deduction based on property one owns does not have significant impact on students\' housing and rent, the rising interest rates set by the US Federal Reserve plays a major role in slowing down property investment and construction of new properties. What this means, is that it will be more expensive to borrow money and thus, developers will be more reluctant to build more properties. The slow growth of available rental properties combined with increasing number of student population each year will eventually result in a possibility of rent increase.\n\n<b>4) </b><b>Assimilation with general population</b>\n\nA lot of people may be wondering how the general population\'s attitude towards internationals have changed after Trump\'s election, if at all. I myself, have had positive experiences since I came to the US in 2012.\n\nWhen I lived in Pittsburgh from 2012 until 2016, I was surrounded by people affiliated with Carnegie Mellon University. Since there are many international students and scholars, I never felt like a minority and I got along well with friends and colleagues, whether they were Americans or internationals. I kept it professional at work and followed all the rules laid down by the university (i.e. when you are in a graduate program under F-1/J-1, your university will be your “host” and they will help you with anything related to immigration).\n\nMoving to upstate New York in 2016, I found myself in an area with a lot of Trump supporters, which was interesting. I enjoy talking to and learning from people. I knew I wouldn\'t get the whole picture simply from reading news from the media. I spoke with friends and colleagues about their worldview from the “Republican” side and learned about the history of the US. Long story short, I have made a bunch of friends here, who support President Trump and are excited with the reforms he has been making. On immigration, one has to understand that Trump focuses on cracking down illegal immigration and low paying H1B-based positions, since they are viewed as a way some corporations use to take jobs from the Americans. With this being said, if you follow and respect the legal routes, watch out for all the rules, and work for reputable companies, chances are you will be just fine.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2609\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"590\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2609\" src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2018/03/Figure-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"392\" /> Assimilation of immigrants with the general population correlates well with the sense of belonging, well being, and productivity. Common sense, such as respecting local customs, speaking the local language, building good relationship with the those closest to us (e.g. neighbors), are always a good start to begin your journey in a foreign land. The figure is taken from www.slate.com.[/caption]\n\nAs a closing note, I want to emphasize that the US is in a very dynamic moment now and will be in the foreseeable future. Under President Trump, the administration is making numerous policy updates, centered toward the “American first” slogan. Keep up to date on the latest news, especially regarding immigration and the US job market as the immigration reform may result in a more challenging environment for those who plan to immigrate to the US. Given that the F-1 OPT and H-1B work visas expire after a few years, keep in mind that immigrants will never truly achieve a piece of mind until he/she has a green card. Also, account for the US tax reform and rental property market, since they will impact on your income and on the lifestyle you can afford.\n\nYour university provides a lot of guidance on maintaining visa status. When in doubt, always consult the International Student Office. Universities are also a great first avenue to get to know people and assimilate yourself to the communities. Observe local customs and respect the rules of the place that you visit and where you live. What is acceptable in one\'s home country may not be so in the US. If you live off campus, ask the landlord of all responsibilities and things expected from you.\n\nYou can find more information on college applications, student/work visa and student life from the net. Websites such as gradcafe, collegeconfidential, and Indonesian Mengglobal (IM) are great resources. To stay up to date on the most recent US news, sites such as Yahoo News and Google News are full of useful information.

You spent many months working on them. You put together the required documents; your diploma, your proofs of awards, recommendation letters from experts in your field, paying for the application fees and attaching the receipts. After all the blood, sweat, and tears, you finally pushed that button and submitted your life summary to your dream colleges. What now? Do you feel empty, excited, and uneasy, all at the same time? I know I did when I was waiting for my graduate school application results. I submitted applications to all the targeted schools by the first week of January and received&nbsp;the first result sometime in mid-March. Those were two of the most dreadful months of my life. There were a lot of uncertainties, questions, and curiosity going through my mind. For those&nbsp;of you who just submitted your applications for the 2018 intake, this may sound familiar.&nbsp;Michael wrote this article to share his experience and steps that he took to make this waiting period easier.&nbsp;He is hoping&nbsp;that these tricks can help you focus on what is important; the present life.</em>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2619\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2619 size-full\" src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2018/03/Figure-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"560\"> A relevant meme on waiting for application result[/caption]\n\n<em><strong>1. Should one contact the Admission Office despite notes stating&nbsp;that&nbsp;you shouldn\'t?&nbsp;</strong></em>\n\nAbsolutely not. Do not even think about sending an email asking; “Hey, can I check the status of my application? Am I accepted to your department?”. Do not do it. As long as you did everything correctly when you submitted your applications and received a confirmation notice that your application has been submitted or received by the college, you are all set. But of course, the urge to ask is strong, and admission committees at many colleges undoubtedly receive such emails even though they clearly state this warning on their websites. By sending them this type of email to check out your application result, you show that you do not heed their message and this will put you in a bad light. Moreover, you are giving the admission committee some extra work, and it may slow them down.\n\nWhat about emailing professors that you are interested to work with? Or contacting a faculty member you have just met at a conference in the past? I believe these are special instances where you can send a follow-up email and mention that you have just applied to their college/department and that you are interested to work with them should you get an offer of acceptance. If you happen to meet the faculty member in a conference during your waiting period, that would be even better. Come prepared with questions about the department, their research, and mention that you are interested to work with them. It is ok to contact the faculty members you want to work with via email as well. Who knows&nbsp;they may like your academic profile and past accomplishments. Maybe you built a good rapport when you met them at a conference in the past. They may have the power to influence the decision of the admission committee. However, keep in mind not to hard press them to help with your applications. It all hinges on their opinion about you and your credentials. It may also be worthwhile to ask this faculty member whether they are accepting new students this year. If they do not, you can then quickly refocus your attention to another faculty member who you would like to work with.\n\n<em><strong>2. Focus&nbsp;to live in the present</strong></em>\n\nWhile you are waiting for your college application results, you cannot just stand still. Life goes on and you have to keep going with your current work, study or else. The period between the application submission and the roll-out of the application results can range from few weeks to several months. Waiting time of 3-4 months is not unheard of. If you slow down in your actual routines, that is a lot of missed time and opportunity. To some, especially those who put a lot of effort, time, and energy into their applications, it is natural to feel a lot of pressure during the waiting time and the feeling may incapacitate&nbsp;them from performing at&nbsp;their best at work. However, it must be fought and can be effectively fought with some simple tricks.\n\nThe first trick to take your mind off your college application results is to have a clear backup plan. Think about the next big thing you want to do should all the applications fail to go through. Find the next best thing you want to do in your life. Write it down on your calendar or on a post-it note posted on your wall. Tell yourself that you\'ll do that one thing if your applications turn out to be unfruitful. It may also be worth adopting an alternate perspective; if you have put so much effort, time and energy into something and yet, you cannot achieve it, your best talent and opportunity may lie in some other untapped territories. And you have plenty of time ahead of you to find that golden opportunity!\n\nThe second trick you can do to keep you focused on your current work or study is to simply take on more responsibilities, more difficult tasks, or more interesting problems to solve. Take a class or a mini project that you always have been genuinely wanting to pursue. When you are deep in your thoughts into something, you will forget about the world and everything else is blurry images. By taking on bigger projects, you are also beefing up your resume. It is a great way to be productive and at the same time, to distract your mind from the lingering thoughts about your college applications.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2617\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"960\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2617\" src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2018/03/Figure-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\"> Tips on how to focus[/caption]\n\n<em><strong>3.&nbsp;Be social and surround yourself with people</strong></em>\n\nSince the waiting period can be very unsettling to some and being lonely definitely does little to help, it is always productive to up your social time and gets active with doing stuff with your friends. Whenever you are surrounded by people and your days are filled up with works or activities with friends, you keep your mind active and do not give a chance to those lingering thoughts about your college applications to make you feel uneasy. Based on my own personal experience, hanging out with some friends and being social at work tremendously help me get through the 3 months period of my waiting for the college application results. I did not curl up in my own comfort zone and irrationally keep checking my inbox every five minutes. And the reason was because I was busy talking and spending time with my friends, colleagues, and families. Get together with your best buddies, spend more time with your family, and learn more things or offer help to your colleagues at work. You would be happy to learn that you have stayed productive through this waiting period when all of this is over and the future becomes clearer. To those who apply to universities in places away from your current domicile, this may also be the last few months you have to spend with your closest friends and family before you embark on the next phase of your life in a new place. Keep that in mind and use your time wisely.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2618\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1280\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2618\" src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2018/03/Figure-3-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"> Making friends while waiting for your university application announcement[/caption]\n<figure id=\"attachment_29691\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">So, there you go. These are few practical things you can do to fill your time waiting for the college application results. Some items and actions shared above are geared towards keeping you busy, active, and productive in those few months of the waiting period. Some applicants put a tremendous amount of effort, time, money, and energy into their future college plan and it is understandable that these few months of waiting can&nbsp;drive them crazy. While you may be tempted to regularly check some crowd-sourced sites where users publish or share their college application results (e.g. to which university, which department, their GPA, GRE scores, etc), remind yourself that you shouldn\'t become obsessed with it and let it slow down your daily activities. Life goes on and you should stay focused on your current job/activities, and make sure you can still perform your best during the waiting period.\n\nFor more information about student life, universities, and college applications, websites such as College Confidential and Indonesia Mengglobal (IM) offer a bunch of useful resources.

Do I send cover letters and resumes to everyone I know? Do I reach out to alumni and ask them for referrals? In this article, contributor Mike Kurniawan shares some tips to effectively job hunt.</strong>\n\nYou graduated from high school with flying colors and worked hard through the years in college. You balanced social time, assignments, prepared for exams, partied hard, hit the gym to stay healthy (or not), kept in touch with your family, and now, you are about to graduate. School is over and you are entering the workforce. Do you feel excited, motivated, nervous, overwhelmed, and confused all at the same time? I know I did. This point in life is a pretty big jump, and some may be clueless on how to proceed and ace the job-hunting game. That\'s the agenda of this article. I am going to share some main points and suggestions which will give you a leg up on your hunt for that dream job you have wanted.\n\n<b>1</b>)&nbsp;<b>Start Hunting Early</b>\n\nIf you attend a 4-year college program, start your job-hunting in your third year. If you enroll in an accelerated program of 3 years, start your job-hunting in your second year. By having a head start, you can learn more about your target companies, go through multiple iterations of your resume, and build strong networks of people who can help you secure an interview at their workplaces.\n\nOne of the first things you can do to start is to think hard about your background and skills, and what you want to do in life. What career do you want to pursue? What role and where (Northeast? West Coast? South?), and ultimately, which company? Research how much the expected salary is. Within this one year of job-hunting, your original plan may change along the way, and that is OK. The point is to start early enough to learn all the things about the industry and then decide if that career is something you would enjoy doing 8-12 hours a day, 5 days a week, for years down the road.\n\n<b>2)&nbsp;</b><b>Use Your Immediate or Adjacent Networks</b>\n\nThere are tons of resources available to you when it comes to networking. First of all, find out about the Career Office at your university. Browse their website and attend the networking seminars they conduct. In most universities, the Career Office even provides services such as resume preparation and mock interviews. On their websites, they usually put some information on expected salary range based on departments, major recruiting companies, and the number of alumni going to particular companies in a particular year. You may even be able to apply to certain jobs posted by some companies on your university\'s Career Office\'s job portal. Professors in your department may have contacts (e.g. former postdocs, former students, or former fellow professors) in some companies. This information can be obtained by visiting the professors\' websites or simply by talking directly to these professors. These contacts may be the bridge to your dream company. Be sure to engage them and learn about your target company through them. There is a tremendous amount of useful resources provided by your university and you need to make sure you exhaust all of them.\n\nWhen it comes to the university job fair, which typically happens few times a year, be sure to come prepared. Dress professionally, practice your elevator speech, bring copies of your most recent resume, read up about the companies you are targeting beforehand, and ask well thought out questions. Some recruiters may catch you off guard and interview you on the spot! If you are in the software or tech industry, it is not uncommon that the recruiters will give you a quiz when you approach them at the career fair. Only if you pass it then you can proceed to the next stage, so freshen up on your coding skills and other technical knowledge.\n\nLastly, use your immediate contacts outside of college: your family and friends. Do any of them work in your target companies? Do any of them work in your target industry? If so, courteously ask them if you could set up a short phone interview or buy them a cup of coffee for their time. Ask them if you can learn about what they do and get an overview of their company or industry. Most people, especially your closest friends and family members, would be happy to help and share their knowledge. So, don\'t be afraid to ask!\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2629\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"484\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2629 size-full\" title=\"job-hunting-usa-online-networking\" src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2018/04/Figure-2-Job-Hunting.jpg\" alt=\"Job Hunting Networking\" width=\"484\" height=\"397\"> In your everyday life, you surely have come across many people and built connections over time. Maintain and nourish those connections. These connections, starting from your family members, distant relatives, friends to your internship colleagues, or former managers, may be great resources when it comes to job hunting. The figure was taken from it.wikiquote.org.[/caption]\n\n<b>3) Utilize All Available Online Resources</b>\n\nThe first point above is about high-level preparation and the second one is about leveraging your networks. The third point I am going to elaborate now is your online presence. A great portion of job hunting and recruitment nowadays happen online, so a strong personal brand online will give you a boost in your hunt.\n\nFirst of all, make sure your online presence is clean and professional. Go through your social media accounts (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.) and optimize your sharing preferences. Recruiters go online to check for candidates\' online profiles; extreme political opinions, insulting comments, pictures of wild parties, or vulgarities are obvious no-nos. You want to be honest with yourself and at the same time, look decent and approachable. Be mindful of what you write and what pictures you post on social media because online content is easy to trace and almost impossible to destroy. We live in a world that does not forget.\n\nSign up for LinkedIn and keep a professional profile. For your profile picture, take a professional headshot, wear a well ironed out shirt (no weird or unconventional pattern, please, unless, if you are in arts or entertainment industry), and have a good haircut. List all your education and experience (only those relevant to the roles you are applying) chronologically and make sure there are no typos. Use positive words that give off an energetic vibe when describing your past accomplishments. Be concise, straight to the point, and do not get long-winded with your profile.\n\nSince you have more flexibility in terms of space to write on LinkedIn, I find it easier to build a good resume after you are done with the former. Draft your resume by summarizing your LinkedIn content. If you are an undergraduate, a one-page resume is suggested. If you are a graduate student with multiple publications, patents, projects, and awards, two pages are the maximum. Start with your LinkedIn and trim it down so that your resume is compact and full of “hooks” (unique, above average, and memorable achievements).\n\nLastly, use other online job search tools such as Glassdoor and Indeed. These two sites are rich with information, including salary by profession and role, past interview questions, company ratings, and employee testimonials. One can learn a lot about a company by reading up on the information available there. You can use this data to help you prepare for your interview, your negotiation, and for you to make an informed decision when an offer is on the table.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2630\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"740\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2630 size-full\" title=\"job-hunting-usa-online-presence\" src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2018/04/Figure-3-Job-Hunting.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"431\"> Be mindful of your online presence. Maintain a professional profile on your LinkedIn account. For your other social media accounts, be wise when it comes to voicing your opinions. Use reason and avoid hot-button topics that are more for personal offline discussion. The Internet does not forgive and does not forget. The figure is taken from itgaq.com.[/caption]\n\nBy&nbsp;combining an early preparation, strong networks, and a great online profile, one is bound to win the game of job hunting. Job-hunting is a marathon, not a sprint. You will be working on the different elements of it (i.e., resume enhancement, mock interviews, actual interview, attending career fairs, negotiation) for months. Be mentally and physically ready. Eat well, sleep well, and take care of yourself. Be presentable and stay fit, especially when you have in-person interactions or interviews with the recruiters. Remember, the first impression lasts.\n\nFor more information on job hunting, career coaching, college life, and college applications, websites such as Glassdoor, lndeed, and Indonesia Mengglobal (IM) offer a bunch of useful resources.

To the high school students who take them, it\'s key that one passes their exams well, especially if they intend to study abroad.\n\nWhile A Level Chemistry can seem challenging, especially with its Papers 4 and 5, one can still earn high grades with proper reviewing and practice. Here are some suggestions to help you on your way:\n<ol>\n <li>A-Level Chemistry, as a whole, assumes that you would have elementary knowledge of the topics learned in its syllabus. If you do not fully understand several of these concepts, e.g. stoichiometry, you should review them far before the examinations start. You will have to practice answering questions, especially structured questions, using these ideas.</li>\n <li><strong>Practice past papers.</strong> While ‘official\' past papers could only be accessed by teachers, there are multiple websites available online where you can freely download them. Treat the papers as exercises first and foremost; then if you feel confident enough, you should do them within an examination setting. Papers 2 and 4 have recurring question topics over the years that one could expect to appear.</li>\n <li><strong>Learn what the examiners will expect from your answers</strong>, and try to answer accordingly. In addition, you could also download Examiner Reports for extra insights into how well the previous batch performed, the questions they generally found difficult, and remarks and suggestions made by examiners for future candidates.</li>\n <li><strong>Use the resources available to you!</strong> The internet is teeming with websites if you ever have difficulties regarding chemistry; sites such as Chemguide, Khan Academy or S-Cool, or even The Student Room are often able to explain the questions you might have about specific chemistry topics. Do not be afraid to ask your teachers and classmates for help as well. Reaching out may even help you to succeed even further in your exams.</li>\n <li><strong>Do not feel disheartened if you do not get good results instantly after your first review or practice session.</strong> Passing A Level Chemistry with flying colors requires your time, energy and determination. A Level Chemistry is very much different from its predecessor; have faith, practice regularly and you will surely do better with time.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Some preparation and exam tips to take note of are:</h2>\n<ul>\n <li><strong>Organic Chemistry</strong>, if learned correctly, will net you a fair amount of marks. The topic appears most prominently in Papers 2 and 4, where they can take up from a quarter to half of the paper. <strong>Rote memorization is not recommended for organic chemistry</strong>, due to the abundance of organic compounds that may appear in questions. Complicated compounds such as ibuprofen, serotonin, and many more are more likely to appear in organic synthesis questions than methanol or ethanoic acid. Furthermore, these compounds would have more than one functional group, and many reagents will react with more than one functional group (LiAlH4 in dry ether, for example, is a powerful reducing agent and is able to reduce not only carbonyl compounds, but also amides, esters, nitriles, and carboxylic acids). Consequently, understanding mechanisms and reactions will come in handy far more than mere memorizing.</li>\n <li>While Paper 1 is multiple choice based, <strong>read each and every question and its options carefully</strong>. Some questions are worded vaguely to ‘trick\' less careful candidates, and often options are so similar that one would miss the difference. Check your answers after you\'ve finished the paper if you still have time to do so.</li>\n <li>Paper 5 may only possess 30 marks, but it is one of the hardest papers a candidate must write. As a result, marks can be easily lost. <strong>Laboratory work is recommended</strong> for this paper, as candidates are tested on their practical knowledge and their ability to assemble and present a proper lab report. If that opportunity is not available, do as many papers as you can and always ask your teacher for feedback whenever possible.</li>\n <li>Paper 3 is practical-based, and if you have had proper training, it is also another easy way to gain marks to make up for any losses in other papers. Do laboratory work as often as you can, and it does not hurt for you to ask for classmates\' help during these practice sessions.</li>\n <li>In doing calculations, showing your working is crucial. You can lose marks for inaccuracies, but method marks (marked by M in marking schemes) are gained based on your working alone.</li>\n</ul>\nGood luck with your revising!', 'chemistry_logo.png', 'A Level Exam Tips: Chemistry', 'publish', 'A Level Exam Tips: Chemistry for high school students', 'A Level Exam Tips: Chemistry', 'A Level examinations are approaching quickly.

Setelah sempat vakum beberapa waktu lalu, kali ini kami kembali dengan pembahasan menarik seputar studi di luar negeri. Untuk artikel kali ini, kami membahas tentang tren aplikasi penerimaan di universitas-universitas di Amerika. Apakah setiap tahun pendaftar semakin banyak? Apakah peluang diterima di universitas ternama semakin besar?\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2674\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"589\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2674\" src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2018/05/Acceptance-Rates.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"589\" height=\"593\" /> Data Rating Penerimaan Mahasiswa Baru di kampus-kampus Ivy League di Amerika[/caption]\n\nDari data di atas bisa dilihat bahwa jumlah pendaftar ternyata tidak sebanding dengan jumlah mahasiswa yang diterima. Untuk universitas-universitas Ivies Plus seperti Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvannia, Princeton University, Yale University, Stanford University dan Massachusetts Institute of Technology, <strong>semakin banyak mahasiswa melamar, malah semakin rendah rating penerimaannya</strong>.\n\nPada tahun 2008 misalnya, hanya <strong>12,42%</strong> mahasiswa yang diterima 226.089 pendaftar. Kemudian, 297.413 siswa yang mendaftar pada tahun 2012 menghadapi kenyataan bahwa persentase penerimaan justru turun 3.19% menjadi <strong>9,23%.</strong> Selanjutnya pada tahun 2016, siswa yang mendaftar di universitas-universitas Ivies Plus kembali tidak bisa bernafas lega karena rating penerimaan siswa kembali turun menjadi <strong>7,94%</strong> dari total sebanyak 336.057 pendaftar. Ivies Plus merupakan kumpulan universitas yang dianggap memiliki kualitas akademik sangat baik. Minat calon mahasiswa untuk kuliah disana tidak akan turun selama universitas-universitas tersebut selalu mempertahankan kualitas akademis dan fasilitas perkuliahan. Meski demikian, persentase penerimaan kemungkinan besar juga sulit meningkat, kecuali jika terdapat penambahan kelas/kuota siswa.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2675\" src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2018/05/General-Trend.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"563\" height=\"575\" />\n\nMari sekarang kita lihat tren yang muncul dari keseluruhan universitas papan atas maupun <em>liberal arts colleges </em>di Amerika Serikat. Pada tahun 2005, terdapat 29,84% siswa yang diterima dari seluruh pelamar. Persentase ini cukup tinggi, dimana sekitar 3 dari 10 pendaftar diterima. Kemudian tahun 2013-2016, persentase tidak stabil dan cenderung turun, berturut turut menjadi: 20,33%; 20,93%; 19,52%; 18,6%.\n\nPersentase tersebut masih tetap lebih tinggi dibandingkan persentase penerimaan mahasiswa Ivies Plus. Pada 2016 contohnya, Ivies Plus memiliki angka penerimaan 7,94%, yang berarti hanya 8 siswa yang diterima dari 100 pendaftar, sedangkan tren umum dengan angka penerimaan 18,6% mengindikasikan hampir 19 siswa yang diterima dari 100 pendaftar.\n\nBanyaknya siswa yang tidak diterima di universitas pilihannya itu seharusnya membuat para siswa SMA saat ini  mempersiapkan aplikasi mereka sedini mungkin. Nilai akademik tidak bisa dijadikan satu-satunya acuan. Banyak orang pintar yang mendaftar, namun hanya mereka yang berkarakter kuat yang kemungkinan diterima. Mereka akan menciptakan kesan mendalam bagi universitas yang dituju.

Students generally admit that it is one of the most challenging processes of the admission, so we suggest you to handle this first. For those who have taken this year\'s SAT or ACT tests, make sure you have the required score for your admission.\n<h4><strong>Universities shortlist</strong></h4>\nShortlist the universities that you are going to apply to as early as possible. You can apply to as many universities as you want, but we recommend enlisting at least 7 options. Once you received a good SAT / ACT score, you will be more confident to aim for universities such as the Ivy Leagues.\n<h4><strong>The documents</strong></h4>\nAnother admission requirement that can confuse you. Each university may require different or additional documents but generally, they request for your academic record, SAT or ACT score, TOEFL / IELTS score, CV, and essays. For the general documents such as academic record and CV, you may use one for several applications. For your essays, however, we strongly recommend that you write them separately for each application to fit the criteria of each university.\n<h4><strong>The interview</strong></h4>\nNot all applicants will be shortlisted for interviews. If you are not invited for an interview, do not panic. It could be because they do not have enough interviewers to speak with everyone. If you are invited, make sure that you give a great impression! For a successful interview, proper preparation is the key. With the help of a mentor, you can learn some useful tips and tricks on how to survive the interview. It is one of the most essential parts of the admission and sometimes, the decisive one so once you passed the interview, you have a bigger chance to get accepted to that university.\n<h4><strong>Visa</strong></h4>\nWhen everything is settled, now is time to manage the legal documents. Applying for the student visa may sound petty especially after you passed the other previous stages. However, be careful not to underestimate the visa application process. Read all the instructions carefully and fulfill all the requirements to ensure your legal permission to live abroad and study in your dream university.\n<h4><strong>Accommodation and settlement</strong></h4>\nFinding a good place to stay in Jakarta is hard, let alone finding one in a foreign country. Get yourself used to lease rules if you are going to rent a room outside campus and get familiarized with leasing glossaries such as deposit, excess wear, tear, or termination. It is better to have someone who is familiar with leasing to assist you in finding the perfect accommodation.  If you are going to stay in the university dormitory, things may be slightly easier.\n<h4><strong>Psychological concern: are you ready?</strong></h4>\nMost students who plan to study abroad may have skipped this point, especially once they are drowned in the euphoria of being accepted in their dream university. Good mental preparation is vital in supporting your study. Research has found that students may face psychological challenges during the first few months of their study, such as loneliness and depression.

Or may we even say essay<em>s? </em>Yes, some colleges not only require one essay, but two, and perhaps even three! These additional essays are known as supplemental essays and they\'re often shorter than your main one.\n\nThough for most universities there is, what one may consider, a “main essay” such as the infamous Common App essay, supplemental essays should not be regarded as less important. The supplemental essay is often specific to a single university and allows the admissions officer to take a closer look at your resume, background, goals, and if you are the type of person that best fits their university.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2770 size-full\" title=\"Tips for Writing an Impactful US Supplemental University Essay\" src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2018/10/Writing-an-Impactful-US-Supplemental-University-Essay.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\">\n\n&nbsp;\n\nToday we\'re going to give you some tips on how to tackle some of the most common supplemental essay prompts.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><u>Why ____ University?</u></strong>\n\nShow. Your. <strong>Research.</strong>\n\nThe university will not be impressed if you simply use the ranking of the university as a reason for your application. <strong>By researching and mentioning specific features of the university, you will show that you are genuinely interested in the university</strong> and have invested your time into really learning about what the university can offer you as well as what you can offer in return. Ask yourselves these questions:\n<ol>\n 	<li><strong>What specific courses in the major (or in a related field) will help me achieve my educational and career goals?</strong>\n<ol>\n 	<li>For example, you want a career in journalism. Courses that may excite you include “how to approach discourse in the media”, “communication 101”, “media history” (how have news been covered in the past), and perhaps even a language class (you may argue that this may be important if you were to report on news in various communities which use a foreign language). The main thing is, look up courses related to your major and show how they are could be used to obtain your goals.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n 	<li><strong>What facilities does the university provide that I cannot access elsewhere? </strong>\n<ol>\n 	<li>This depends on the major you are trying to apply for. A university hospital would be useful for students wishing to enter the medical field by providing a space for hands-on training, while a state-of-the-art football stadium would be great for students wishing to pursue a career in sports. This will show the university that you will <strong>maximize your opportunities outside the traditional classroom. </strong></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n 	<li><strong>What opportunities does the university offer that is unique and beneficial for my goals?</strong>\n<ol>\n 	<li>This ranges from <strong>study abroad</strong> opportunities to <strong>“Co-Op” programs</strong>. Remember, be specific. What specific countries would you like to visit? And for what reason? This should mostly relate to <strong>how it will enrich you academically</strong> as opposed to regarding it as a fun “vacation”. Specificity also relates to the Cooperative Education or “Co-Op” method and <strong>internship programs</strong> where you will gain <strong>hands-on experience in your field</strong>. What are some major companies that the university has partnered with before that you would love to intern in? What do you hope to get from the possible mentorship program the university offers? Remember, not all universities may have these opportunities so do your research.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n 	<li><strong>What values does the university have that I embody as well?</strong>\n<ol>\n 	<li>Look at the <strong>university\'s motto</strong>. This is often either one line or multiple. If they are multiple, you can pick a few and talk about <strong>how you agree and aim to contribute to them</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n 	<li><strong>Why do you like the city or location of your university? What does it have to offer you?</strong>\n<ol>\n 	<li>This is <strong>not as important</strong> as talking about the programs offered by the university, <strong>but it adds to the enthusiasm. </strong>For example, your university is located in a large city. You can talk about the art museums, bowling alleys, theaters, Broadway shows, music scene, etc. Conversely, you may be going to a smaller or more rural city. You may say that you are excited to be part of a friendly small community, go to festivals or fairs, or enjoy the serenity of your environment. This portion should be roughly around 1-2 sentences and should not be the focus of the essay.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\nThese <strong>questions are meant to jumpstart your brainstorming process</strong> so do not be alarmed if not all the questions would apply to you. Additionally, closing remarks of your essay should <strong>show how excited you are to join the university\'s community</strong> and that you will make full use of the opportunities given both by the university and its environment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><u>Why did you choose ____ major?</u></strong>\n\nHere you must show your <strong>enthusiasm for your major</strong>. Your <strong>reasons should not be superficial</strong> such as choosing the major solely for the potential of its financial securities or saying that it simply sounds “fun”. Make your essay dynamic. <strong>Talk about topics concerning the past of your intended field, its present, and its role in the future. </strong>A great way to begin is to <strong>think of a problem that</strong>, with the help of your major, <strong>you would want to help solve</strong>. Ensure that this <strong>problem is both specific and, perhaps, even personal</strong>. For example, you\'re an aspiring medical student who has an aunt who suffers from Alzheimer\'s. Your high school experience has been marked with several papers on the topic. However, you feel that your resources were limited, and you would like to continue your research at the university. This is a great reason to choose your major. You should also ask yourself <strong>why the major is the right fit for you and why are you attracted to it. Extracurricular activities, everyday experiences, and fascination in the field generally should be testament to your interest in the subject.</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><u>Extracurricular Activity Questions</u></strong>\n\nThe university will often ask you to go in depth with one of your extracurriculars you have mentioned before. What\'s important to note is that the <strong>extracurricular activity you choose should show</strong> roughly these four things:\n<ol>\n 	<li><strong>Passion</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Commitment</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Leadership</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Impact to community</strong></li>\n</ol>\nAnd you should discuss all these aspects in your essay.\n\nIn the beginning of the essay, <strong>state clearly your role and how from that role, you were able to gain important academic and life skills</strong> from it. This includes learning to be communicative, a team player, analytic, organized, among others. After this, you would <strong>also add how you would like to expand or continue this activity in college as well as in your future endeavors</strong>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><u>Quirky Essay Topics (Write about Anything)</u></strong>\n\nThe <strong>freedom </strong>of this prompt can either make or break the writer. This essay should show your uniqueness so <strong>don\'t shy away from the unconventional</strong>. To give you an example of how “strange” these essays could be, one girl wrote her essay on her dimples being so deep that they could fit multiple skittles! <strong>Write about anything that plays to your strength. If you are a funny person, write something funny. If you are a serious person, write something serious yet impactful. </strong>Don\'t be afraid to <strong>take risks! </strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCollege essays should not be something taxing. It should be fun and an exploration to also get to know yourself better. One thing you should remember though is that you shouldn\'t need to overwork your essay. You should know when to hold back and when to push harder. Sometimes you can knock it out of the park the first time, and sometimes you need more work. Both are very normal when writing. You should always get outside opinions and be open to criticism. However, in the end, <strong>this is your essay, and this is your story. Tell it the best way you can. &nbsp;</strong>\n\n&nbsp;', 'Writing-an-Impactful-US-Supplemental-University-Essay.png', 'Tips for Writing an Impactful US Supplemental University Essay', 'publish', 'Tips for Writing an Impactful US Supplemental University Essay', 'essay', 'In this article, we’have some tips on how to tackle some of the most common supplemental essays prompts.

However, this is a very limiting way to look at it. Diversity could also mean having a range of different beliefs, experiences, religions, sexuality, political ideologies, gender, among other identity markers. Each of these identity markers has quite different approaches to them.

Where you grew up in may be very conservative and traditional whereas you might find yourself to be more liberal. This <strong>clash of morals</strong> and thought patterns may make you feel persecuted or perhaps more aware of your surroundings since you think differently than the majority. You can <strong>talk about some of these differences and explain how it affects you and your outlook on life.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n 	<li><strong>Diversity in religion or faith</strong>\n<ol>\n 	<li>You may be a religious minority and you would like to talk about your experiences being one if it\'s very impactful to your identity. <strong>Depending on your unique experience</strong>, you can talk about <strong>the obstacles you face</strong> because of your different faith <strong>or</strong> even talk about the <strong>religious harmony</strong> <strong>that exists in your society. Being a minority is not unfortunate to everyone.</strong> If you had a positive experience of being a minority and being welcomed by your community, that would be a great topic as well.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n 	<li><strong>Diversity in experience</strong>\n<ol>\n 	<li>Perhaps you have very <strong>different life circumstances or opportunities which can be both positive and negative</strong>. You may talk about how your parents\' jobs took you all over the world, how your brother had autism and you spent a lot of your time learning about autism and helping him, how you were chosen as a school representative for an incredible debate competition, or maybe even how you began writing poetry and finding your passion. <strong>Our lives are unique and even stories that may seem simply mundane at first glance, are worth telling if done correctly.</strong> What have you learned from it? <strong>How</strong> have these <strong>experiences shaped you into the person you are today?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n 	<li><strong>Diversity in sexuality</strong>\n<ol>\n 	<li>This is still very controversial across all parts of the globe and it may be difficult to write since many still disagree with it. However, <strong>sexuality can be an integral part of someone\'s identity, shaping how they view the world and how the world interacts with them</strong> in return. Sexuality, like other identity markers, are treated very differently in different communities. <strong>How were you treated? How do you hope to be treated in the future?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n 	<li><strong>Diversity in Expression</strong>\n<ol>\n 	<li>Perhaps you dressed differently, wore your hair in one may consider an “outlandish” fashion, or you wore terribly heavy makeup which caused people to stare at you. As a person who moved from one country to another, I noticed these differences of reception. Back home, my country was more conservative and monoethnic. Dressing or looking different got you unabashed stares in the public. <strong>If the way you expressed yourself outside of the norm, how was your experience doing so?</strong> Were you <strong>scared?</strong> Did you feel a sense of <strong>empowerment? Talk about your journey </strong>of not being afraid to step outside the box and how you were treated by your society.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n 	<li><strong>Diversity</strong> <strong>in political ideology</strong>\n<ol>\n 	<li>This is also another very controversial topic. Depending on the university you\'re applying to, you must <strong>be careful</strong> when choosing to talk about political ideology. When applying to a <strong>conservative religious university</strong>, perhaps your <strong>views may be more conservative to suit the views of the school</strong>. Whereas if you\'re applying to a more liberal school (prominent research institutions are generally liberal), then your political ideology should <strong>align to more liberal ideas</strong>. <strong>However,</strong> there are always exceptions to the rule. Thus, it is very <strong>important to justify the things you say</strong> or believe because it <strong>shows your thought process and how your environment shaped</strong> <strong>the way you think</strong> of the world and its politics.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n 	<li><strong>Diversity in gender</strong>\n<ol>\n 	<li><strong>How has being a man or a woman shape your opportunities in life? </strong>How do you think you have navigated your community because of it? Did you have an experience where you were <strong>discriminated</strong> against because you were a certain gender? That you were fitted into certain <strong>gender roles that you did not agree with?</strong> This can pertain to both men and women, especially if you have difficulty fitting into what the very binary stereotypes that society pushes. Were you a man told to never cry and show emotion? Were you a woman who was told to stay at home and not have any career aspirations? <strong>How did this change you as a person?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\nThus, you must <strong>dig deep into your identity. Who are you? What is your background or culture? How did you fit within that culture? </strong>Then you may talk about how this will affect you and stay with you as you enter your university abroad? A general rule of thumb however, is to <strong>avoid being overly negative</strong> (whether that be to your new environment or to your old one). <strong>Even if your experiences have been overwhelmingly negative, show how you would like to improve it and move forward positively into the future. Your experiences should enrich the university, fostering understanding </strong>as opposed to divisiveness. You may also talk about the diversity present in the university you are applying to by searching up its demographic composition online. Then also talk about how you can benefit from this diversity of appearance and ideas present in the university that you cannot find as common back home (especially if you grew up in a monoethnic area).\n\n&nbsp;', 'Diversity-Essay.png', 'Answering “Diversity” Question – US Supplemental University Essay', 'publish', 'US Supplemental University Essay: Answering “Diversity” Question', 'supplemental university essay', 'Diversity means having a range of different things.

Factors include size of the city, type of area (suburban, urban, rural), culture (lax or fast-paced) cost of living, and availability of internship and work opportunities.</li>\n 	<li>It\'s all about preference and what you would like to gain from your study abroad experience.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nLearn about the experiences of other international student studying abroad\n<ul>\n 	<li>Compare the differences in each country like the curriculum, academic rigour, and many more.</li>\n 	<li>Use social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram to get a small taste of what it would be like studying at particular global universities (there are a lot of YouTube vlogs that show you around the campus and the city of certain universities).</li>\n 	<li>Learn about international student experiences can help prepare prospective students in adapting to a completely different culture and educational structure.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nResearch universities you wish to go to\n<ul>\n 	<li>Go beyond face value or “name”. Ensure that the school is good for what you want to study, that the environment is one that you can see yourself striving in, etc.</li>\n 	<li>Most obvious method is having prospective students visit university campuses abroad.</li>\n 	<li>Research using the school\'s official website and use social media to engage with them.</li>\n 	<li>Knowing about how to apply, the general requirements for the school, application deadlines, scholarships, and more about the admissions.</li>\n 	<li>Chat with school staff and current students in real time or with alumni because many universities uses various means to communicate with prospective students</li>\n 	<li>Hire an independent educational consultant to help prospective students determine what they consider important factors in a good university experience and find institutions that fit into what is wanted.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nAccount for all costs\n<ul>\n 	<li>Students should remember to account for costs beyond tuition which include daily living expenses.</li>\n 	<li>Pay attention to the currency rates because the exchange rates can fluctuate day to day creating an inaccurate illusion of how much one is spending.</li>\n 	<li>Plan to have additional funds as a reserve.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nHaving strong English-language skills (if the school offers an international or English curriculum)\n<ul>\n 	<li>Prospective students should be prepared for lectures and assignments as well as conversations between classmates and professors that are entirely in English</li>\n 	<li>Depending on the requirement for the individual university, you would have to take an approved English exam and meet certain grade cut-offs to qualify. Some schools provide foundation programs for students who don\'t meet their language requirement and that process could be different from their usual application process. Take the Test of English as a Foreign Language or the International English Language Testing System exam to meet the school\'s English language requirements</li>\n 	<li>To practice, read and write in English daily. A helpful tip is to read novels, create summaries of what you read, and watch movies without subtitles to familiarize yourself with the language and how it is spoken by its native speakers.</li>\n</ul>\nWe hope these tips can be very useful and helpful for you.

If the institution has waitlisted you, most likely it\'s because they still see you attending their university.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, how do you get off it?</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How to move from the waitlist on to the admit-list</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.Make sure you\'re REALLY on the waitlist:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read your universality verdict letter\ncarefully. Make sure you\'re really on the waitlist and note down any additional\ninformation the letter has provided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Properly research the university</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that you really want to put in the time and effort to be\naccepted to this university. Check their programs for your major, their\nfacilities, faculty, location, price, among many other factors that you find\nimportant in a university.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Accept the waitlist invitation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn\'t assumed that you accept the waitlist so make sure you\naccept the offer on paper or virtually as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Prepare new information</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some schools may ask you for additional documents such as recent\ngrades, recommendation letters, and another essay pleading your case and what\nyou\'ve done since you first applied. If your recent grades are not as\nflattering as you hoped, do not attach them. Instead, if the university allows\nyou to submit another essay explaining your recent achievements or your\ncircumstances, then take that chance. Even if these additional documents are\noptional, it is best that you submit anything that can redeem and make yourself\nmore favorable to the admissions officers reconsidering your application.\nHowever, make sure you\'re not repeating your previous application. Bring new\ninformation only. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Be mindful of dates and making decisions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some colleges already expect a reply to their offers so make sure that you have a backup college and that you accept their offer. If you get off the waitlist, then you must accept the new offer and decline your back up school\'s offer immediately. Be mindful of any enrollment fees that you cannot get refunded. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nBut for now? You wait.\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you\'ve done all that, be proud of yourself.&nbsp; You\'ve worked hard throughout high school and have worked hard throughout this whole process. Stay positive and be grateful for whatever verdict you receive. </p>', 'Uni-Waitlist-1-e1556075716607.jpg', 'Why Did I Get Put On University Waitlist?', 'publish', 'Why Did I Get Put On University Waitlist?', 'university waitlist', 'Getting a waitlist notification may seem irritating.

The summer break is here and you might be wondering: how can I lead a productive break? Having been in the same position before, we\'ve got your back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we have prepared a list of alternative summer plans to help you with your studies and ease you into the university admissions process. Let\'s check them out! </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2019/06/Summer-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4267\" width=\"512\" height=\"288\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Personal Projects</strong><br>What means a lot to you? What gets you excited? There may be projects that you always wanted to realize but couldn\'t due to the demands of your studies. Summer is the perfect time to start! Here are some examples:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Passionate in&nbsp;<em>filmmaking</em>? Think of a short story that you want to tell. Write up scripts, storyboards, and invite a few friends to make your dream become reality! You can even do your own research, work on your editing, and take inspiration from your favourite movies! From this, you can learn to multitask, be creative, work with others, and have pride in what you have accomplished.</li><li>Passionate about <em>sports?&nbsp;</em>Make a team for the sport of your choice with your friends and underclassmen. You can have fun while being a coach, taking responsibility, and polishing your interpersonal skills!</li><li>Passionate in&nbsp;<em>computer science?&nbsp;</em>There are many free online websites that can teach you to code. You can also make your own apps, games,&nbsp;and perhaps, show them to your friends after summer. This is a great way to slowly build your portfolio and experiences.</li><li>Passionate about&nbsp;<em>social change</em>? Work for a nonprofit or perhaps learn from them. You can always start making your own campaign about something you\'re passionate about. Though being a leader or the face of something can be daunting and you might feel that you are too young, do not be discouraged. If you have something important to say, people will listen.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides doing these projects because you absolutely love them, personal projects look amazing when you\'re applying to college and they highlight how you have continued to perform well outside of formal academia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Internships & Volunteering</strong><br>Another great way to brush up on your leadership, interpersonal, and career-oriented skills is through interning or volunteering. With the current boom of startups and up and coming companies, there are always companies looking for young talents to help them with their exciting projects! By doing internships or volunteering, you can get insight into the professional work environment and expand your network. Don\'t know where to start looking?

It may be long, it may be challenging, but it does not mean that you cannot be confident during it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you must choose the schools you want to attend. Create three categories: reach, match, and safety schools. Then begin searching for several universities that match each category. We suggest around 10 schools to be on your list. After doing research on what would be important to you (location, major ranking, facilities, communities, among others) you can take a look at what each university requires for their admissions.<br><br>This can take up to several months.

On one hand, you may have had a relaxing break but on the other, you might be itching for some mental stimulation. For those thinking of going to university in the US and are entering Year 12, the upcoming 12 months might seem daunting. But don\'t worry! The key to a successful admission process is preparation. Check out some of our useful tips below! </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2019/07/Personal-Branding.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4327\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Polishing Your Personal Brand</strong><br>The biggest difference when applying for universities in the US versus other universities abroad is the emphasis on a holistic approach. This means that the admissions committee looks at its candidates beyond simply their test scores such as the SAT / ACT. They also require impressive extracurriculars and a killer essay. Who are you beyond a number? Who are you beyond the classroom?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A competitive candidate possesses a distinctive set of strengths and interests identifiable through what they pursue outside of mandatory classes. This lets the admission committee know that you are the right candidate for their university. Most people begin building their personal brand as early as Year 9 &nbsp;through leadership opportunities and joining clubs or projects they find interest in. However, if you\'re in Year 12, you might want to reflect on what you have done thus far and begin drafting a comprehensive timeline of your activities. This professional timeline can be created in the form of a CV or a resume. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2019/07/Typing.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4328\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Drafting Your CV</strong><br>What do I need to put on my CV? Do I need to enlist&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;the student organizations and volunteer work that I have done throughout high school? What are some things that I should NOT put on my CV? Composing a good CV can be tricky since it should support your brand whilst being concise. What kind of student do you want the admissions committee to see? In the end, you want the committee to be&nbsp;<em>impressed&nbsp;</em>by your activities and remember you as a person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the committee is less likely to be interested in trivial information, only mention essentials such as academic achievements, internships, leadership opportunities, or volunteering experience. If you joined our recent Summer Science Research Program, you can definitely include that! If you don\'t have enough materials for your CV just yet, we have some activities that can help you, such as our internship program&nbsp;<strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"here (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://all-inedu.com/experiental-learning/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></strong>! </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2019/07/essay.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Essays</strong><br>Perhaps the most dreaded part of the admissions process, the essay portion could either break or make you as a candidate. However, if you are well-prepared, it will not be as “scary” as you might think. The first step is to brainstorm. What qualities and subsequent stories would you like to talk about? What interests and motivates you? What are your ambitions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get a clearer understanding of what the admissions committee might want to see in these essays, check out the common application essay prompts from the previous admission year. For the most part, they remain relatively the same every year so you can begin drafting your essays as early as Year 11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Essay Prompt Samples:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Describe a problem you\'ve solved or a problem you\'d like to solve. It can be an intellectual challenge, a research query, an ethical dilemma - anything that is of personal importance, no matter the scale. Explain its significance to you and what steps you took or could be taken to identify a solution.</li><li>Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others.</li><li>The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?</li><li>Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Though these topics may sound easy, remember that you are not composing a straightforward essay. Yes, you will still have to answer the prompt clearly, but you will also have to be a great writer to show and paint your story without simply telling it. These essays must not only be unique, but also a clear reflection of your skills, values, and what you will contribute to the university\'s community. The admission committee members can already see your grades elsewhere; the essay is a great opportunity to showcase who you are beyond that. They receive thousands of essays from all over the world and you need to give them reasons why they should be interested in YOU.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly stressed out? Don\'t be! Our team of mentors and editors have gone through the same process and know how to help you create essays that pack a punch! From the brainstorming stage to that pesky grammar and content construction issues, our Essay Writing Program is meant to guide you start to finish.

How can you boost your chances\nof getting in? Is it too late to do anything?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is <strong>No!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below, we have compiled a list of activities you can still do in your senior year.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Search for <strong>Volunteering Opportunities</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best\nways to boost your CV is by helping out in your local community. Volunteering\ncan range from providing assistance at your local pet shelter to being part of\nthe operations team of a non-profit for disabled adults. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to\nenjoy your time while giving back to society is by pursuing an opportunity\nwhere your heart lies. What social, economic, or societal issues are <em>you</em>\npassionate about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if\nyou are going into the medical field, you should take the opportunity to work\nin a blood drive! Being surrounded by likeminded people in your field of\ninterest is also an invaluable way to network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some links to volunteering opportunities in Jakarta or Indonesia in general:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://coconuts.co/jakarta/features/7-awesome-jakarta-volunteer-organizations-need-your-help-right-now/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2019/08/Coconut-co-logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4344\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.indorelawan.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2019/08/Indorelawan-logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4345\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Find a <strong>Part Time Job</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working at a\nStarbucks after school or at a local cake shop shows your grit and\nperseverance. It also teaches you a host of life lessons that you can then\napply to your future educational and career-related endeavors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many part time jobs that do not require you to be physically at the job site. Take remote freelancing for example. You get the opportunity to learn what it takes to work in the gig economy, new skills, and interact with people of all background while being paid for it!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p> 3. Get Involved in a <strong>Research Projects</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contact local\nuniversities or research institutes in your area and ask them if they have any\npositions open for high school students.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may even ask your teacher if they have any projects they are pursuing outside of school and ask if you can help or shadow them. Being close to your teachers inside, and perhaps outside of class by doing additional work, leaves a good impression which is needed when it is time for them to give you your predicted grades or recommendation letters when applying to university. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Start Your <strong>Personal Project</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you find fascinating? What is something you have always wanted to pursue or create but just haven\'t had the time to? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting your personal project is never too late. Whether it be something considered “small” such as starting your art portfolio or the first chapter of your book, to create an app and a marketing scheme for it, personal projects can be exciting. They show your passion, your determination, and your ability to follow through with your plans. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will look great for universities as they will see what you have pursued beyond grades and academics. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Mention <strong>Household or Family Duties</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Extracurricular\nactivities worth mentioning are not always what we imagine them to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being part of your family\'s main source of income or being a caregiver is also included as an activity you do outside of school. This includes regularly babysitting your siblings while your parents are away working, or perhaps cooking and cleaning for the whole family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of the additional duties you have other than being a student or a kid. What can you think of? </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Turn your niche passion into an extracurricular activity!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps you have a quirky hobby that does\nnot quite fit into what impresses academically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, it is something you are genuinely interested and have a great passion for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could range from writing short stories\nin the corners of your notebooks or perhaps even gardening to supplement your\nrapacious desire to experiment with food. Your niche hobby could be what\ndistinguishes you from all the other students working in professional\nenvironments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, one of our students loved geckos! He eventually became a gecko breeder in Jakarta and is obsessed with the whole culture of trading geckos. From doing so, he learned business strategies, expanded his network, and most importantly, showed his individuality to future admissions officers.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What should I take from this?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, if you are lost and confused,\nopportunities are a google search away! And it\'s even better if you have\nconnections that can help introduce you to open positions in various\nindustries. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\'t know where to start?

One of the many important things for university admissions includes <strong>university application essays</strong>.<br><br>A common misconception between the university application essay and the chance of admission is that, aside from great/excellent grades, you have a pretty high chance of admissions to top universities as long as your essays are “super-polished.” When I say “super-polished,” I mean essays with perfect English, no grammatical errors, and great content narratives.<br><br>Sure, “super-polished” essays do contribute to increasing your admission chances, but that doesn\'t mean you should overlook your CV/resume as well as other application materials such as letters of recommendations, proof of accomplishments, among others.<br><br>So, what happens? There tend to be discrepancies between the essays\' contents and everything else in the applications. This raises red flags, lowering admission chances instead of increasing it.<br><br>Whenever my students and I begin brainstorming and preparing to write their essays,&nbsp;<strong>ONE</strong>&nbsp;thing never fails to hinder their essay writing process:&nbsp;<strong>identifying their EXPERIENCES</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on their experiences, the types of students that I have worked with can simply be categorized into three:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Students with rich experiences,<strong>&nbsp;but confused which one to be highlighted to strengthen their essay.</strong></li><li>Students with rich experiences,<strong>&nbsp;but forget their experiences.</strong></li><li>Students with rather less experience during their high-school and&nbsp;<strong>feel they have got nothing to write.</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the type, there is one thing for sure: it is definitely possible to<strong>&nbsp;dig through their experiences, find something niche that reflects their unique personality, and guide them on what should (and need to) be highlighted in their essays&nbsp;</strong>in order to strengthen their application profile.<br><br>What to highlight does NOT have to always be academic-related or school-related per se. It can be something as simple as habits, hobbies, personal interests, or even a specific quirk. The key is to figure out “<strong>Why do they do these activities</strong>” and this is what I believe would lead to an amazing essay story showcasing the students\' experiences that are, of course, aligned with everything else they include in their applications.<br><br>The process of university application essay writing (and essay writing in general) is similar to cooking. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2019/11/Cooking.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4703\" data-link=\"https://all-inedu.com/?attachment_id=4703\" class=\"wp-image-4703\"/></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nIn cooking, you need three main elements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Raw materials and spices</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The more varied your materials and spices are, the easier you can come up with a variety of unique/interesting menu because you simply have more options.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cooking utensils and skills</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The more you have in your arsenal, the more techniques that you can use in cooking your food making it tastier.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Presentation</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are cooking for a gathering event where there are many people that you may or may not know, the better the presentation of your food, the more chances there are for these people to become tempted in reaching out for your cooking.<br><br>Now to make a logical comparison between cooking and university application essay writing, the following are the main elements of essay writing:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Experiences:</strong><strong>&nbsp;Raw materials and spices</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The more experiences you\'ve obtained in high school, the more options you\'ll have in coming up with an essay topic. Thus, the easier it will be for you in starting your essay.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Writing skills:</strong><strong>&nbsp;Cooking utensils and skills</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The more English writing practice you have prior to Year 12, the more variety of sentence structures, word choices, and command of the English language you can use in your essay. This will result in a good quality essay (content and writing)</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Narration:</strong><strong>&nbsp;Presentation</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Since you are writing these essays to showcase your unique qualities, you want to make sure that your reader (which are strangers from the university admissions office) is interested in reading your essay. Thus, packaging your story into a unique and interesting narrative will tempt these officers to want to know more about you, imprinting your name into their minds.<br><br>In a nutshell, you can obtain all the three elements above and have a much easier time producing great essays&nbsp;<strong>ONLY if you are well-prepared by gathering as many experiences as you can&nbsp;</strong>starting from your earlier years in high school. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2019/11/Admissions.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4704\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>REMEMBER!!!</strong>&nbsp;Top universities use a holistic approach in reviewing their student candidates. It means that they not only look at your academics and essays, but they also want to know your personality: passions, interests, quirks, habits, etc. In other words, anything they could find to get to know you better both as an individual and as a student. As such, you need to be able to package your application such that you can back up who you are and what you\'ve done (i.e. experiences) with concrete proof in your CV/Resume as well as other aspects in your university applications.&nbsp;<strong>These experiences that you input into your CV/Resume will become your valuable raw materials and spices</strong>&nbsp;for your essays.<br><br>So, here are a couple of tips for you, especially 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and 11<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;graders, to think about:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Engage in as many extracurricular activities as you can as soon as possible</strong>.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>These activities will not only enrich your experience, but also enable you to explore your true passion and interest useful in determining your future university major down the road.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Do internships or participate in social-impact-rich / volunteering programs/activities once you have determined your passion and interest</strong>.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The experiences you\'ll get from these will strengthen your major focus of study in college and, simultaneously, showcase your unique skill sets that can potentially become a major added value when applying to your target universities.<br><br>At the end of the day, your participation and commitment to your selected activities will serve you well throughout your university application journey as well as your self-development and professional development journey.<br><br>One more thing, whenever I ask my students about their extracurricular activities, most of them would open up about the difficulties in finding activities that they are truly interested in because they are limited to the ones they have at their respective schools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Well, I know that ALL-IN EDUSPACE offers a number of experiential and enrichment programs to students like you who are still in the exploration stage.

It may start with a uni major research in junior high school, or a profile-building since the start of high school.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you who target universities abroad, especially in the UK and US, you might have bumped into UCAS and Common App.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we are going to highlight some of the fundamental information that makes them different.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What is the Common App? What is UCAS?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>UCAS</strong> is a UK-based organization whose main role is to operate the university application process for British universities. <strong>The Common App</strong> is an undergraduate college admission application that applicants may use to apply to universities in the US. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of them are organizations that allow students to apply to more than one university in one go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the things you want to know about <strong>UCAS</strong> and the <strong>Common App</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Where can I use UCAS and the Common App?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>UCAS </strong>only applies in the <strong>UK</strong>. Whereas <strong>the Common App</strong> applies not only in the <strong>US</strong>, but in selected universities in China, Europe, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Switzerland, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What are the distinct differences?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Both UCAS and the Common App use an online system for the application, which means it needs you to set up an online profile where you put your personal details and other requirements to complete your application. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the drill is practically similar, we highlighted <strong>3</strong> things you should note.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Selecting <strong>Courses</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For <strong>UCAS</strong>, you can select<strong> five courses</strong> at maximum in one application. This can be either choosing five different courses under the same college or university, or choosing five different courses at five different colleges or universities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the Common App provides a<strong> Dashboard </strong>where you can add colleges to your list up to <strong>20 colleges. </strong>This list is adjustable at any time before you submit the application.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Admission Essay and Personal Statement</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>UCAS </strong>application needs you to articulate your interest to study a particular course at a university and show the experiences you possess in a <strong>personal statement</strong>. Thus, you only need <strong>one</strong> personal statement in your UCAS application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <strong>The Common App, </strong>you have to write an essay based on a prompt provided by the Common App besides a <strong>college-specific essay, </strong>if the school requires one. So, if you apply to more than one university, you may have to prepare a few college-specific essays for your application.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Deadlines</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The key dates you should mark for the UCAS application would be <strong>October 15th </strong>and <strong>January 15th. </strong>October 15th is for all applications to the <strong>University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, most courses in medicine, dentistry, </strong>and <strong>veterinary medicine/science</strong>. And January 15th is for all applications to the majority of undergraduate courses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, for the Common App, it depends on whether you apply for <strong>Early Decision</strong> or <strong>Regular Decision</strong>. The Early Decision deadline is typically on <strong>November 1st,</strong> while the Regular Decision is typically on <strong>January 1st</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deadlines for the application in the US also vary by schools, so make sure to always stay up to date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you interested in knowing more about UCAS and the Common App?

Have you picked up the quirks of virtual courses and figured out how to get better online course experiences?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we all are aware, the COVID-19 has put limitations on our everyday mobility. Schools all over the world shifted to virtual interactions to cater to students\' best interests.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re already in the last quarter of 2020, and the next admission cycle is right around the corner. For you, 12th graders, it is time to gather up your portfolios and prepare your university application. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this blog entry, we are specifically discussing the upcoming US university admission cycle and the changes that appeared after the COVID-19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many changes this year, it\'s unfortunate to say that the 2020/2021 university applicants are facing more challenges due to the <em>newly shaped </em>admission process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Different kind of challenges that rose during the lockdown</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As schools enforced online learning, it brought complexities in the transcript process, from grading assignments to exams. The new virtual method also affects the community where students struggle to keep their grades up as a result of the lack of resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the academic transcript, most universities have made the standardized test requirement optional for the 2020/2021 admission cycle. Even so, the policies were not created equal. Some schools still require SAT/ACT for specific majors, or selective schools, like MIT, cancel their SAT Subject requirement. This only creates further questions on how the application will be fairly reviewed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both grades and standardized tests have been crucial in university applications, especially for international students. But with this year\'s special case, admission officers might have to take it easy in reviewing both grades and standardized tests.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, it is predicted that new applicants will have to face increased competitiveness where there will likely be applications to school with test-optional policy and from deferred applicants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2020/09/wesley-tingey-snNHKZ-mGfE-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"6661\" data-full-url=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2020/09/wesley-tingey-snNHKZ-mGfE-unsplash-1.jpg\" data-link=\"https://all-inedu.com/?attachment_id=6661\" class=\"wp-image-6661\"/></figure></li></ul><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption\"><em>It is predicted that 2020/2021 admission will increase in competitiveness where there will likely be applications to school with test-optional policy and from deferred applicants.</em>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>With the two central differentiators off the main spotlight, how will you appeal to top universities with your applications?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With challenges, also grow new resolutions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After months of working with students virtually, we think the way to differentiate yourself from other applicants is <strong>quality over quantity. </strong>Where you work on the aspects of your application that shows yourself beyond the quantified grades or test scores.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned with us to talk more about the qualitative elements to boost your university application in the pandemic-influenced admission cycle.&nbsp;</p>', 'wesley-tingey-snNHKZ-mGfE-unsplash.jpg', 'Challenges in This Year’s US University Admission Cycle', 'publish', 'Challenges in This Year’s US University Admission Cycle', 'Admission', 'With the COVID-19 crisis this year, the 2020/2021 university applicants are facing more challenges due to the newly shaped admission process.', 'en', 0, '', 'false', '2020-09-14 17:00:00', '2020-09-04 17:00:00', '2022-11-02 17:00:00');

Things like your character, curiosity, inventive mind, and impact will most likely be the main actors of your application.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Universities usually take on a holistic approach where they see you not only from one aspect&nbsp;but many. For instance, they want to know about <em>you </em>beyond grades, your hopes and dreams, your uniqueness, your story, <strong>your brand.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, how can you show that to your dream college?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is by utilizing your<em> </em>admission essays, letters of recommendation, and admission interview, to their<em> </em>fullest potential.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, yes, it is not a new drill to work these substantial requirements in the best fashion possible. Additionally, there are new updates you should know first before creating your application.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Update for Your</strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>College Essay</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Among thousands of 400-word college essays, what kind of information do you think the admission officers seek?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than academic interest, they want to know what kind of student you are and how you will fit into the university. You must portray your interests, creativity, willingness to work hard, and other unique qualities. Most importantly, connect your traits with your dream university, and describe how you will fit in perfectly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2020/09/glenn-carstens-peters-npxXWgQ33ZQ-unsplash-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"6678\" data-full-url=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploaded_files/blogs/2020/09/glenn-carstens-peters-npxXWgQ33ZQ-unsplash.jpg\" data-link=\"https://all-inedu.com/?attachment_id=6678\" class=\"wp-image-6678\"/></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, <strong>the Common App</strong> added an optional prompt that allows you to share about how COVID-19 impacted your life. Thus, you are able to show your perseverance and resilience during the trying time, as well as how you grow and move forward from the obstacle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, you must be mindful if you opt to answer this prompt. You would want your dream universities to see you as someone thoughtful and not as someone trivial and insensitive. So, you need to specify your obstacle during the pandemic instead of writing about how the lockdown ruined your summer fun-plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the pandemic does not make a significant change in your life, you can choose other additional prompts that will benefit you more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Make an Impact on Your Surroundings</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enroll yourself in summer courses or internships?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a commonly known fact, you need to fill time with extracurricular or immersion activities to deepen your knowledge about your preferred field. Indeed, it will also emphasize your characteristics, leadership, and communication skills, all things that you want to include in your application.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, how will you earn those benefits if your plans for internships or other activities are canceled?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It gets challenging when you have to be active in order to build a good resume but what you can do during the pandemic is limited. However, it is where you get reviewed by the admission officers; what you make out of things accessible to you during the lockdown and also how do you contribute to your surroundings during the crisis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Truth is, there are many things you can do online to still have a productive time. You can join courses or workshops online as a way to learn and further sharpen your technical skills. You can also build a <strong>passion project</strong>, even dedicating the purpose to&nbsp;help your society during the crisis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be creative and resourceful in finding what useful activities you can do. Show how you contribute and utilize your best qualities to bring good in a trying time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Letters of recommendation&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The key points you should note for your letters of recommendation are the tangible evidence of your qualities provided from other perspectives. The admission officers seek qualitative information that makes you truly exceptional, and not only as a well-credentialed student.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, many of you have lost direct interactions with your mentors and teachers from school. Although you still have classes and courses online, how will you keep connected to your instructors in the way you did before the social distancing?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before virtual classrooms, the interactions and relationships that kept the class dynamic are the foundational aspects of the classroom itself. Now it\'s your turn to figure how you are going to perform and engage during your courses online as well as you did in the in-person classes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, keep being curious, responsive, and intellectually engaging in the online classroom. Show your teachers and mentors that even with challenges you are still a strong and achieving student.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are the things we extracted from the new situation of the admission cycle this year. For you, students, we hope that you can note important things from this information and figure out how you will fill your university applications.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good luck and see you next time!</p>', 'glenn-carstens-peters-npxXWgQ33ZQ-unsplash.jpg', 'Tackling the Pandemic-influenced US University Application', 'publish', 'Tackling the Pandemic-influenced US University Application', 'university', 'Universities take on a holistic approach where they see many aspects of you.

(7474, '4-reasons-why-traditional-study-methods-dont-work-anymore', 3, 0, '4 Reasons Why Traditional Study Methods Don\'t Work Anymore', '<p>Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, a large population of students and teachers were forced to continue lessons in a virtual setting. The global pandemic has not only revealed weaknesses in each country\'s public health infrastructure but in the academic sector as well. Especially for the class of 2021, their last year of schooling was not easy, and many students found themselves with bad study habits and degrading test scores. Not to worry, though, as we will help you break down just what it takes to leave those old habits behind and get started on sustainable study methods.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Reading and Rereading texts&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most common and fatal mistakes students make is that reading the textbook or notes counts as studying. In fact, studies show that reading is not an “active studying technique” and does not often result in improved learning experiences. <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0260137940130504\">(Mackenzie, 1994)</a> What this means is that while the information we need to get in our heads is usually in these texts, spending hours at a time staring at the e-textbook in your laptop won\'t do you any good, and will just end up tiring out your eyes. Instead, try using your textbook and notes to formulate a <strong>study guide</strong>, and come up with your own questions and problems, with complete answers for them. In this way, your brain will learn the concept twice: while understanding the answer and creating a good question for it.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Highlighting Important Points</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another very common habit for students is to use colorful pens to underline and highlight the key points of a lesson. While highlighting does improve learning, it cannot do students any good alone. A good supplemental activity to pair with highlighting is to <strong>paraphrase and reflect.</strong> By using <strong>intentional learning strategies</strong> alongside highlighting, students are encouraged to internalize the key concept of every paragraph read, paraphrase it in a way a child would understand, and come up with questions to inquire further understanding. It is important that students understand the importance of intentional learning, and that they actually grasp what they are learning, and not just memorize facts and phrases.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Reviewing One Topic at a Time</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While this may sound odd, <strong>interleaving practice </strong>is actually a more effective study method compared to <strong>blocked practice</strong>. In blocked practice, students attempt the same type of question over and over again, until they feel they have gained mastery over it. For example, practicing multiplication repeatedly before moving on to division and fractions. However, a more effective method is to <strong>interleave</strong> different types of questions into a single set, such as practicing addition, subtraction, and division problems along with multiplication in one sitting. This allows the brain to have to work to solve different types of questions at the same time, which promotes critical thinking and better understanding of why multiplication is different from addition, and how it is related to division.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Leaving the Testing to Teachers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last few generations, testing has gained a huge negative stigma in the student community, with so much emphasis placed on getting high scores on standardized testing as a requirement to enter prestigious universities. This results in students having a bad reaction to tests, seeing them as obstacles in their academic journey when in reality, they can be a useful tool for studying. <strong>Pre-testing</strong>, <strong>flashcards</strong>, and <strong>self-quizzing</strong> are all good practices that can enhance a student\'s ability to perform well on tests. Pre-tests allow students to identify which aspects of a topic or lecture that they understand the least, and can improve on. Flashcards are a great tool for memorizing short, essential information such as dates, percentages, and terms. Self-quizzing is also good, as it tests a student\'s ability to recall items from their short and long-term memory, depending on when it is used.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, as the world around us continues to evolve, learning and studying has evolved along with it, and we need to keep up. With new academic infrastructure being set up to improve the welfare of online learners, we need to keep up and adapt to it as well!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>', 'jeshoots-com-2vD8lIhdnw-unsplash-scaled.jpg', '4 Reasons Why Traditional Study Methods Don\'t Work Anymore', 'publish', '4 Reasons Why Traditional Study Methods Don\'t Work Anymore', 'Study methods', 'Many students found themselves with bad study methods and degrading test scores.

Did I forget to mention that mock exams are just around the corner? </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Should You Get Help With Your College Applications?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During this time, university applications can be both challenging and stressful, especially if you don\'t have someone in your life who\'s familiar with the process. Despite the abundant information that flooded your way, from school counselors, or endless hours of scouring through websites, or watching tutorials, it\'s normal to feel lost and unclear. But it also means that you should seek out ‘help\'. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is nothing to be ashamed of. You could be pretty much confused with anything and everything. But seeking out guidance, brainstorming, and getting constructive criticism from mentors can be very helpful in this journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Some Problems You May Encounter During the Process (But Not Limited To):</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>You can\'t figure out which universities to apply to</li><li>You\'re not sure how to write your essays</li><li>You don\'t understand the requirements of your university</li><li>You\'re not sure how to prepare for or when to take your standardized tests</li><li>You\'re not sure what the scholarship requirements are</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Identifying the problem that you struggle with makes it easier to understand from who you might want to seek help. Whether it is your school counselors, graduated seniors, admissions officers of the university you are applying to, or even an all-around mentor. Some may not have all the answers, but chances are they can direct you to someone who can.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>My Experience</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Before ALL-in Eduspace</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having had shortlisted my universities and their respective application requirements, I started working on drafting my personal essay around August of my senior year. I still recall spending days just sitting and staring at my laptop screen not knowing what to write about. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward to a month later, I managed to write 4 drafts, still clueless if I was even doing it right. And with my days blurring into Google classroom assignments and deadlines stacked one after another, the process of writing application essays got even more tedious. I realized school assignments would never end, and putting off applications to do it last minute could be disastrous. That\'s when I approached one of my seniors for help and found out about ALL-in!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>After ALL-in Eduspace</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the help of mentors at ALL-in, I was able to get a sense of direction through brainstorming essay outlines and personal branding. Getting a clearer picture of what I was communicating through my essays, and detailed and constructive feedback helped me portray the best version of myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>REMEMBER! You are&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;getting someone else to do the essays for you, it was still all on me. But you are seeking out the guidance you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>With Mentor vs Without Mentor</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td>Guidance from experienced and skilled mentors</td><td>Possible confusion from reading tons of websites, guides, and resources&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>More efficient as you know what you are doing</td><td>Wasting time on doing something you are not sure of</td></tr><tr><td>Direct and focused feedback on all essays</td><td>Asking friends to read, limited feedback</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, don\'t be afraid to reach out for mentoring. After all, not everyone has it figured out their first time applying for universities. Know that doing it all alone can get mentally draining, especially under the pressure. Seeking mentoring helped me not just secure offers in all my universities that I thought I might not get into, but also helped me embrace the journey. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\'t forget to give yourself the time you need and appreciate all the support you get, including that from your family!</p>', 'green-chameleon-s9CC2SKySJM-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'Why Do We Need Mentors to Prepare for University Applications?', 'publish', 'Why Do We Need Mentors to Prepare for University Applications?', 'mentors', 'Why would you need mentors to prepare for your university application?

These are the necessary tips for those who are not naturally gifted at writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is academic writing and why is it important?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Academic writing is typically intended for highly educated people who have a basic understanding of the topic in question. It is also known as a tool of communication that delivers in a certain field of study.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Academic writing requires a great deal of research. You need to produce informative and fresh essays. You cannot simply repeat previously published ideas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to succeed in the competitive world of academia, you have to be able to communicate your ideas through academic writing. As a student, your writing is the only door to your thoughts for readers in the academic world. Hence, you need to find out efficient ways to boost your academic writing!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to improve your writings?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s a great thing that you are reaching us! Here we provide some essay writing tips you can apply to massively build your best writing for academic purposes!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Understand the argument and provide the evidence</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you start writing an academic essay, you need to make sure that you have your main argument in mind. Do some research to support your hypothesis. Read more papers as they can inspire or even give you amazing fresh ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, don\'t forget to provide supporting evidence for your writing. By having strong and reliable evidence in your paper, you can enhance your credibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, every time you read some papers or journals from books or reliable sites on the internet, always ask yourself if the evidence you find will support your thesis. If the answer is no, then you do not need to put it into your essay. Be critical every time you evaluate the evidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Start making an outline&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Know what you want to say before starting writing an academic essay. One of the easiest ways to create a good argument is to outline the topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understand the basic structure of academic writing which includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An introduction.</li><li>The body includes discussions about the evidence you have found. Use at least three good points that directly support your academic writing.&nbsp;</li><li>A conclusion that ties all your findings together.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to get a better understanding of how to build an outline and start writing your essay, you need to practice. Thus, try to write for a little while every day to increase your confidence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Practicing this will let you express your ideas to the paper more naturally. This part is one of the must-know essay writing tips for students of all grades or levels.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Get to the point</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to always remember what your reader needs. The first paragraph of your essay should outline the main points of what you want to try to deliver. This will let your readers understand the primary topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, when you want to write for a professional community, do not waste your time defining general things that they already understand about. You must get to the point!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Use the right style, grammar, punctuation, and vocabulary</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want your research to be taken seriously, do not underestimate the importance of style, grammar, and punctuation. Before producing academic writing, make sure you have a good understanding of basic grammar that includes a subject agreement, verb, pronoun, and well-formed sentence structures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also need to understand when to use a period and comma. Finally, whenever it is possible, use the active voice instead of the passive one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that it is an academic writing that lets you take a role as an expert who can build an intelligent argument. Sometimes people think that using big words will give them good feedback. However, this is not necessarily true. If you are not sure of a word\'s meaning, do not use it. Therefore, choose vocabularies that are clear and to the point. Avoid unnecessary transition words in your essay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Edit, edit, edit!</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to academic writing, editing is a very essential process. Read your draft aloud. By hearing it, you will know if your sentences are too long or the structure is too complicated. This strategy will help you examine spelling or grammatical errors and to eliminate excess verbiage for more quality essays.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Write a proper conclusion that supports your research</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Do not copy and paste your thesis to arrange a conclusion. A proper conclusion should quickly be the key evidence in the body of your academic writing. There are many great essays written, but with weak conclusions. Do not let yours be the next!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there you have it! We hope these tips will help you create the best writing. Good luck!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for a way to practice?

Since the forced closing of schools and recreational centers due to the global pandemic, governments around the world have been patiently awaiting the day to safely reopen schools and universities to host in-person classes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it turns out, 2021 seems to be quite an eventful year with most cities relaxing restrictions for international students to resume learning on campus.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Canada</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cicnews.com/2021/03/canadian-universities-to-return-to-in-person-classes-this-fall-0317420.html#gs.12gsgx\">In Canada, most universities in major cities are expecting to open up for international student entry</a>. Popular campuses like the University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University, University of Toronto, and University of Manitoba among many others across the country aiming to resume in-person teaching for classes. The general trend among Canadian universities is the expectation that undergraduates will return to campus in the Fall 2021 semester and attend offline classes, with the exception of large lectures that will still be conducted remotely.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>United States of America</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For students who have secured seats at US universities, it is more likely than not that your campus will be accepting international students to return as early as in the summer. Although this cannot be generalized for all institutions across the USA, the national consensus is that all schools have the best intention to resume normal classes as soon as possible. Similar to Canada, most schools will adapt a hybrid learning environment, excluding huge lecture-based courses from resuming in-person to gradually adjust to the decreasing rate of&nbsp; COVID-19 transmissions. <a href=\"https://www.bestcolleges.com/blog/list-of-colleges-that-require-covid-19-vaccine/\">In addition, there are some schools that require students to be vaccinated prior to arrivals,</a> such as Boston University, Yale, Cornell, and the University of California system.

International students will continue to study remotely until indoor settings resume. Fortunately, labs and practice-based learning classes have started since March 8. <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/977819/Students_returning_to__and_starting__higher_education_in_the_spring_term_130421.pdf\">For international students traveling to the UK, be sure to check when their in-person classes will start and let the university know when your arrival will be, to receive adequate support from them.&nbsp;</a><br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Japan</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of the countries better adapted to handling the initial outbreak, Japan is looking to reopen as of July 1st, with 60% of schools considering a hybrid model and 16% considering to host fully in-person classes. Overall, over 80% of university-level classes in Japan will be at least hybrid or distance-learning. <a href=\"https://www.mext.go.jp/en/content/20200904_mxt_kouhou01-000008961_1.pdf\">MEXT is also looking to support students on scholarships with the option to delay or change their scholarship schedules to account for semesters spent online.&nbsp;</a><br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Australia</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although one of the first countries to almost eliminate COVID-19 nationally, Australia still keeps its borders closed to international travelers. However, Victoria has recently announced that starting from May 24, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-04-27/victoria-to-open-to-foreign-students-actors-major-events/100096992\">borders may reopen to allow international students, film actors, and crew, as well as major event organizers, to trickle in at a rate of 120 people per week</a>. These international arrivals will follow the existing quarantine system and will take place at a hotel outside of Victoria until they have been cleared of the virus. Despite still requiring the approval of the Commonwealth, the recent success of the&nbsp; Australian Open tournament played a huge role in the creation of the plan.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, it seems like countries around the world are starting to open up for international study, and that students can finally get a chance to be on campus once more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>', 'dom-fou-YRMWVcdyhmI-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'Will Universities Reopen in 2021?', 'publish', 'Will Universities Reopen in 2021?', 'Universities Reopen', 'Since the forced closing of school due to the global pandemic, governments around the world have waited the day to reopen schools and universities.', 'en', 0, '', 'false', '2021-05-10 17:00:00', '2021-05-21 17:00:00', '2022-11-02 17:00:00'),

These are most likely the reasons why more Indonesian students decide to study abroad these days. Furthermore, going to study abroad has been made possible by the numerous scholarships available from various countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Universities and educational institutions in each country provide a range of scholarships and study options. This has been made possible by the numerous scholarships available from various countries. The Indonesian government even has its own prestigious scholarship, The LPDP, which is managed by the Finance Ministry. Every year, this scholarship provides significant financial assistance to Indonesian students who wish to study at the best educational institutions around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are most likely hundreds of thousands of Indonesian students studying abroad who are supported by the LPDP, other scholarships, or even their own funds. For these students, there are some top countries that become the top destinations for studying abroad, probably due to the availability of highly reputable universities that frequently make the list of the world\'s best. Here are some of those top countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The United States</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For decades, the United States has reigned supreme as the most popular study abroad destination in the world. With over 5,500 universities and colleges across the country, the United States offers an unrivaled range of programs. Whatever your interests and career goals are, you\'ll find a subject that\'s right for you. This is what draws students from Indonesia with a thirst for academic excellence to study in the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Project Atlas, the United States hosted more than 1 million international students in total in 2019, including Indonesian students. The flexible academic system and multicultural environment are two of the reasons these students choose the United States as their study destination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>United Kingdom</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the world\'s oldest and most prestigious universities can be found in the United Kingdom. International students, including Indonesians, usually work to support their education. This is due to the fact that flexible opportunities to fit around university schedules are not uncommon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the United States, the United Kingdom is proud of its vibrant and diverse society. The country also has a long history of welcoming people from various backgrounds and cultures. So, Living here means living in an inclusive and welcoming environment. This is why many Indonesian students choose to study in the United Kingdom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another advantage of studying in the United Kingdom is that you will improve your language skills. English is a global language that is essential for global business and diplomacy, and becoming fluent in it will provide you with numerous international career opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Australia</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Australia is one of the world\'s most popular destinations for international students, particularly those from Indonesia. Almost any subject you can think of can be studied in this country. Thanks to the wide range of programs!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tuition fees are lower than in most other English-speaking countries, so studying here will not cost you a fortune. Even though tuition fees are lower, this country is home to world-class universities and colleges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason why many Indonesian students choose to study in Australia is that the country allows international students to work twenty hours per week. This aims to cover their personal expenses during their stay. As a result, many students from all over the world work part-time in Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Malaysia</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of its proximity to Indonesia, Malaysia has become a popular study abroad destination for Indonesian students. The country is also appealing due to its religious, linguistic, and cultural similarities to Indonesia. Furthermore, the strong migrant networks that have emerged may provide a comforting cultural environment for Indonesian students.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from that, Malaysia is home to a number of branch campuses of international universities, such as Monash University in Australia and the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. They provide the chance to obtain a degree accredited by these universities at a lower cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Japan</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Japan is one of the most famous study destinations for Indonesian students due to its enhanced higher education institutions. Among the other reasons that Indonesian students choose Japan to study is that the country is widely acknowledged for being a safe place to live, with a good healthcare system, and for being a very friendly place for people from different cultures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Japanese government\'s initiative to recruit more international students appears to be paying off. If you study here, you will be able to take advantage of the country\'s scholarship programs as well as the international support services provided by the majority of universities. In addition, an increase in the number of English-taught programs has raised Japan\'s international popularity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the study abroad destinations mentioned above, we believe you have a good idea of where you want to study abroad.

These things are also selling points, and a good report card can complement these factors.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>#3 Application Highly Increases as the Universities Adopt Test-Optional</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The acceptance rates of the Ivy Leagues are known to be very low making it highly competitive for admission. However, that didn\'t stop the wave of interest from students all over the world to apply.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2020/2021 undergraduate admission cycle set the highest <a href=\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2021/04/08/the-test-optional-revolution-what-does-it-mean-for-the-ivy-leagues-next-generations/\">36.3% spike of applications to the Ivy League schools</a>. But<strong> this unprecedented event was due to all schools\' decision to go with the test-optional application.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many applicants think that with the SAT or ACT out of the equation (optionally), they will have more chances of being offered admission. But even so, there are still applicants who include their test scores in their application. Now, which team will you be in the next admission cycle: team SAT or team test-optional?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you debunk some of the myths, are you feeling more confident to shoot your shot?<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what, it\'s still tough to get into an Ivy League. These prestigious institutions carry rigid acceptance rates and strict requirements to make it in. It\'s difficult, stressful, and complicated.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here at ALL-in, our mentors have graduated from top universities around the world (including the Ivies), and know just what you need to be accepted into an Ivy League university. And if you\'re aiming for just that, we can help you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On <strong>August 14th - 15th</strong>, we are hosting a <strong>University Application Bootcamp </strong>with courses targeted to you students who want to apply to Ivy League schools.

If this applies to you, then you are going to want to continue reading.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every student has different university plans, whether it be studying abroad or studying in their home country. When it comes to studying abroad, you can say that one of the most famous study destinations would be the home of the industrial revolution, the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK is full of top universities for various different undergraduate majors. Those universities are in many different locations in the UK, ranging from those in city areas to even those in rural areas. Situated in the midst of the UK, however, are two well-known institutions frequently mentioned by people all around the world due to their recurring cameos in movies and their prestige. Do the names Oxford and Cambridge ring a bell to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oxbridge (Oxford and Cambridge) is essentially two of the UK\'s most famous universities combined. Not only are they famous, but they are also very prestigious and have the highest ranks based on numerous sources. Due to its popularity, admission to both schools is very difficult with low acceptance rates. Even with high competition for a seat in these schools, it is still not impossible to be admitted to one of these schools (read: “one” because you\'re only allowed to apply to one of them) by being aware of some important information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ace your tests&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important things to know about admission to Oxbridge is that these schools only focus on your academics. Unlike other schools that care about your extracurriculars, Oxbridge will only be more interested in you based on the A* you get or the 7s you get, depending on the curriculum you are taking. To ensure that chance, make sure to maintain your scores and academic performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Remember the Additional Requirements</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Oxbridge still makes use of your predicted IB and A-level scores, they will still go through extra lengths to ensure that you are the perfect candidate to be admitted to their schools.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, depending on what course you are trying to apply to, Oxford will require you to do an additional test and for some courses, they will require you to submit additional essays or coursework. If you\'re lucky, you might be invited to do an interview.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When applying to Cambridge, you are required to submit an SAQ. This will be used by Cambridge as a means of gathering extra information from you regarding some of your personal details and will even assess you on some additional A-level courses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Oxbridge Interview</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike other universities, admission to Oxbridge will require an interview. The interviews they conduct are like a simulation to Oxford tutorials and Cambridge supervisions. Quoted by Peter Millican from the University of Oxford, “We will disagree with whatever you say, be prepared to debate and don\'t worry that we think you\'re wrong”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that, unlike other universities, the due date to submit your application to Oxbridge universities is <strong>October 15th every year</strong>. This means that you will have to start preparing your essays and applications as early as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you ready to embark on your OxBridge application journey, you can join us at <strong>OxBridge University Application Bootcamp</strong> on <strong>August 21 & 22!</strong> In this intensive university application workshop, you will <strong>work together with the existing students of Oxford</strong> to build your application that highlights your achievements and passion!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Register now by going to <a href=\"http://www.bootcamp.all-inedu.com\">bootcamp.all-inedu.com </a> and headstart your OxBridge application! </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>', 'sidharth-bhatia-_QstzxTWnXY-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'Tips and Tricks to Study in UK’s Top Universities', 'publish', 'Tips and Tricks to Study in UK’s Top Universities', 'oxbridge', 'Getting ready to apply to OxBridge requires top preparation.

(8836, 'career-preparation-101-for-high-schoolers', 7, 0, 'Career Preparation 101 for High Schoolers', '<p>As a high school student, the age-old question you\'ve probably been getting is, ‘What do you want to be in the future?\'. Oftentimes, you\'re not even sure what to answer, and that\'s totally normal! Before landing into the employment realm, you have to make sure to have a clear picture where you want to arrive in the future. Career planning is a process that helps you navigate your career interests and, ultimately, helps you choose a career path. You can start your career planning and preparation from now! If you\'re still confused, here are some tips to kickstart your career preparation and give yourself a competitive edge!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Know yourself</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-assessment is the starting point for any major and career preparation and planning. It\'s the time to get to know your passions, skills, interests, and personality so that well-informed decisions can be made. It\'s not often when high school students are aware of their interests but not of their strengths.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking self-assessments and scheduling an appointment with a mentor to discuss the results could be among the ways to discover and get to know your strengths and skills. Remember, rather than trying to fit into a major or career, start with understanding yourself!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Research about possible career options</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you are aware of the activities and subjects that catch your heart, take some time to think. Discover job fields and majors or minors that resonate with your interests, talents, values, and personality. But of course, always keep an open mind as there may be other occupations that you are unaware of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In spite of everything, always stick with the big picture: identifying your career options! If you have set your heart on a professional path, the next step is to shortlist the university majors. This is crucial, since the major you take will help you excel in that career.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be mindful that your career will be defined with the intersection between your strengths, areas of interests, as well as where you want to make an impact. Hence, your major will not always define your career path!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Gain Practical Experience</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you successfully complete your research about possible career options, it\'s vital to gain an in-depth outlook in the real world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to acquire experiences through internships, volunteering, freelance work or part-time jobs. Whether it\'s paid or unpaid, gaining experience while in high school will pave the way for your future employment and help you to uncover more about the work environment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking part in various internship programs will further assist you to figure out what you like and don\'t like. Doing internship makes you experience a ‘day in the life\' of various careers. Keep in mind that nothing beats a hands-on experience!&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Connect with people outside of your classroom&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out about different careers, you could ask people around you such as your neighbors, family, teachers. Get them to storytell their career and college experiences. Consider asking if you can shadow him or her at work on a temporary basis to determine if you will thrive in the particular career environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way of obtaining connections with professionals is through LinkedIn, also known as the professional Facebook page! Connecting with others in your potential field of interest might enhance your educational and professional networks. This way could extremely be beneficial for you in the future.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Prepare your resume and cover letter</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In today\'s employment market, CVs and resumes have risen to the top of the list of the requirements sought by potential employers. An employer wants to meet you - on paper - before investing valuable time in an interview. You really need to pay attention on how you will craft your CV in your career preparation plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A CV or resume typically cover details of your work experience, education, qualifications, and the accomplishments you\'ve made. It\'s similar to an advertisement in that it sells you, your skills and qualifications, and the benefits you have to offer!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Develop and refine your skills</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With the advancement of the digital world, you could literally learn anything on the internet! While still in high school, you can build and improve your technical or digital abilities such as basic programming, basic design or data analysis which could equip you while you\'re on the&nbsp; way into the 21st-century profession.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only your technical skills, developing fundamental skills are also vital! Without realising it, fundamental skills such as teamwork, analytical thinking, as well as problem solving could be found in your daily high school routine. Group projects for instance could promote teamwork skills, while problem solving could be found when you\'re doing your math homeworks!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Start early</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One common misconception is that your career preparation plan begins during college. Nonetheless, one thing to bear in mind is that it\'s never too soon to begin preparing for your future. In this way, you can fill up any gaps that you have through getting better grades, gaining experience, or even earning community-service hours.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you know high school marks an entrance towards adulthood and the more grown up problems. It could be your last hurrah before entering the real world, but don\'t be discouraged to craft your future that might bring you contentment and delight.

It can be difficult to know which information to include in your CV; what is the essential information that will impress recruiters?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some things to keep in mind before building your CV. Firstly, make sure to avoid unnecessary content and it is no more than 1 page in order to be sufficient.

Contrary to popular belief, studying hard isn\'t as effective as studying smart. In any case, we got you some pointers to help you face the upcoming exam on the right foot!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Stop cramming all your study session at once</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\'re the type of student who usually puts off studying until the last minute, maybe it\'s time for a change. When you cram everything in at once, your brain doesn\'t have the chance to process or create long-term associations about what you\'re learning. You could be studying to remember instead of to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a regular basis, try to skim through the materials to refresh your mind and gain a better understanding of the concepts. It can be a quick 15 to 30 minute session where you go over the notes from class. Of course, it\'s easier said than done, especially with the latest Netflix movie grabbing your eyes. Nonetheless, keep in mind - consistency is key!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Start with the hard stuff first</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In how many cases do you start with the most challenging task on your to-do list? Probably not much, right? Almost all of us prefer to start a study session with simple tasks as a form of ‘warming up\' before moving on to the more difficult ones. Unfortunately, once the trivial tasks are out of your way, your brain has run out of its battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian Tracy, a time management expert, refers to tackling the difficult tasks first as ‘eating the frog\'. The difficult task is your frog, and if you start by ‘eating your frog\' without spending too much time thinking about it, the rest of the tasks will be much easier to complete.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Get some breaks</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\'re studying, there might be times when the words and concepts aren\'t making any sense. In case that happens, remember to set out a 10 to 20 minute break during your study session. Within the break, you can do a quick 10-minute workout, stretch your body, or even have a snack to lower your stress level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stress of studying that lasts as briefly as a couple of hours, according to a study conducted by UC Irvine researchers, can alter the process of creating and preserving memories. Therefore, keep in mind to take breaks, but don\'t let them consume too much of your study time!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Test yourself with practice problems</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you always feel extremely nervous whenever a test is coming up? Your heart may race really fast, your hands might be soaked in sweat, and your mind just goes blank. Well, if this resembles you, consider doing practice problems after you\'ve finished reviewing and reading the notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to research, answering practice problems during your study period enhances test results more than studying for the same length of time. Yes, mistakes may arise, but it\'s an excellent tool to evaluate if you are actually remembering what you\'ve learned and which topics you have mastered. Most importantly, pre-testing helps to reduce test anxiety as you can be familiar with what you\'ll be facing on the upcoming exam.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Make sure there\'s no distractions</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As humans, we all get distracted by something. It could be anything - your phone, the TV, your family, even the silence in which you can hear your own heartbeat. It can be difficult to keep focused when there is so much going on, but it is not impossible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First things first, tag a study spot that keeps you comfortable, and most importantly, filled with things that cannot break your study flow. If you\'re with a study buddy, ensure both of you respect each other\'s boundaries and have the discipline to warn each other in case anyone gets distracted. When you study with external distractions, the brain analyzes and gathers information in less beneficial ways, resulting in knowledge that is less capable of absorbing new materials.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Stop multitasking</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When you multitask while studying, you might feel that your productivity is at its finest as you can complete multiple tasks at once. Nonetheless, with limited attention spans and frequent distractions, research has shown that people who multitask are rather flipping between tasks, not doing two things at the same time. As a result, performance on both activities worsens, and task-switchers are less likely to recall information afterwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process of learning and mastering a material requires intense concentration, and the interruptions that come from trying to multitask drains the brain as well as increasing the time required to complete each task.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that building good study habits, just like any new habit, requires time and effort. Focus on forming one or two of these habits at a time, and once they\'ve become a regular part of your routine, you can introduce new ones.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Set your new study habit with help from ALL-in Eduspace!

If you have numerous interests, keep in mind that you can complete a double major or add a minor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\'re still exploring your interests, don\'t worry: about 75% of college students begin their freshman year with an undeclared major!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Understand the finances</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Studying in the US can be costly, particularly for international students. Aside from tuition fees, there are a few other expenses to keep in mind, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Student visa</li><li>Housing or accommodation</li><li>Health insurance</li><li>Travel costs</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Apply, apply, apply!</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\'ve narrowed down your list of universities and selected the program of choice, the time of starting your application has arrived!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before applying, you should be aware of the application dates, as there are four different types of application deadlines:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Regular decision - usually falls in January, with the latest deadlines in March&nbsp;</li><li>Early action - a nonbinding option that falls in early November, with three outcomes of being accepted, rejected or deferred</li><li>Early decision - dates back in early November or early January, with students legally bound to attend if accepted&nbsp;</li><li>Rolling Admissions - a first-come, first-serve basis up until the school\'s class is full</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When applying, you can use either the school\'s own website or a third-party system like the <strong>Common App</strong> to complete your application. In case you didn\'t know, the Common Application is a centralized platform that allows students to apply to multiple colleges at once. When applying to UC campuses, there is one exception: you can use their own application system, <strong>My UC Application</strong>. The fee for each application to US universities and colleges ranges from $35 up to $100.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to international admissions, most US universities require students to take an English as a second language test, such as the TOEFL, IELTS, or SAT exams. Some other requirements include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>School transcripts</li><li>Standardized test scores<ul><li>SAT or ACT</li><li>English proficiency test scores (TOEFL, IELTS)</li></ul></li><li>Copy of passport</li><li>Essay</li><li>CV or resume&nbsp;</li><li>Recommendation letters&nbsp;</li><li>Financial proof (for some universities)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Issuing a visa</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to mention the fact that you\'ll require the most important, though frequently overlooked, document: student visa!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three types of visas available in the United States:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>F Visa - issued to students who are attending at US universities or colleges</li><li>J Visa - issued to students who are participating in an exchange program at US colleges or universities</li><li>M Visa - issued to students who engage in non-academic or vocational study or training in the United States</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that\'s just some part of the basics on how to study in the US.

In addition to the Common App Essay and college-specific supplemental essays, you will also need to complete the Common App Activities section when applying to college.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The activities section is one of the 7 sections in the Common App that you need to fill out. According to Common App, “activities may include arts, athletics, clubs, employment, personal commitments, and other pursuits.” Basically, every venture that you do outside the classroom qualifies as an activity. This section can show your interests, passion, and pursuits. You can list up to 10 activities, so make sure to highlight the most meaningful ones!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article will give a brief information and basic know-how to ace your activities section in the Common App.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Section Overview</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For each activity, Common App will ask you to fill these basic information:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Activity type (e.g., art, athletics, community service, debate/speech, foreign language, research, social justice, work)</li><li>Participation grade levels (9, 10, 11, 12, post-graduate)</li><li>Timing of participation (during school year, during school break, all year)</li><li>Hours spent per week</li><li>Weeks spent per year</li><li>If you intend to participate in a similar activity in college (yes/no)</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you have to briefly describe the activity and your position. You have limited space in these fields, so you may need to simplify your grammar or abbreviate some words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Characters allowed:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Position/Leadership description - 50 characters</li><li>Organization name - 100 characters&nbsp;</li><li>Activity details, honors won, and accomplishments - 150 characters&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Strategies</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>List your activities</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You can list your activities in order of importance and impressiveness. Activities that are listed earlier should capture the admissions committee\'s attention, so point out what activities that matter to you.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Tell a “story”</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Make the activities sound as impressive as possible. Write down the skills and achievements that you acquired and what impact that you brought while doing them. It will also be a bonus point if the activities influenced your ambition for college.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Put related activities together</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of putting eight or nine random activities in various fields, it\'s better to list down two to three activities with the same theme that you were dedicated to. This helps to show your growth and consistency to the field that you have interests in.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Tell your achievement in a quantifiable way</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Be specific with your contribution and achievement. If possible, you can tell it in numbers so the admissions committee has the idea of how big your impact is. For example, instead of writing “Created a fundraising and clothes donation campaign”, you can also add “raised Rp15,000,000 and gathered over 100 clothing items”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to prepare your uni admission through Common App?

Common Application, or Common App for short, is a centralized admission portal for over 900 college institutions, including Ivy League schools and elite universities like Stanford, Caltech, and the University of Chicago. To apply to these colleges, one important thing you need to do is submit a Common App essay, the main personal statement.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To write one, you\'ll get to choose one of seven prompts that are given and the essay must be between 250 to 650 words long. Writing the Common App essay is something that you need to work on seriously. Here in this article, we\'ll tell you some Do\'s and Don\'ts that will help you write your Common App essay in a more effective way.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Do\'s</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Make sure that your essay writing structure are clear</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to write your essay, you need to make sure that it has a clear beginning, middle, and ending. Write your essay like how you would write a story. Make sure that each of these elements are not missing, so you have the perfect storyline and avoid confusing the reader. Craft your essay to be compelling so it will be easy to read.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Focus on your character</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Always remember that this is your essay and it is supposed to show who you are, things you have accomplished, and things you have yet to offer. Through this essay, you need to figure out how to show what makes you unique. You can show a slice of your life and write in a way of how you talk in real life. Make sure that the words you use don\'t feel like it\'s coming out from a dictionary or thesaurus.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Keep the positive tone</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Present your essay in a positive light. You can write your weaknesses, failures or mistakes, but use phrases to uplift your message. For example, instead of stating that you have been struggling with math throughout your academic life, you can describe it as a challenge that taught you self-discipline, hard work, and determination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Don\'ts</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Too much worrying on the prompts</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, you need to read through the prompts to have a clear idea on what to write, but don\'t stress too much over it. Not all Common App essay prompts are created equal. Some will work for others and not for you and vice versa. Don\'t be stuck on choosing which prompt you want to read. Instead, you can work your essay in backward: start with a topic first, then see which prompt fits with your topic. No need to be worrying on the prompt too much since the Common App prompts are broad enough to accommodate almost any kind of story.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Let people meddle in your essay&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it\'s your parents or teachers, don\'t let others be involved in your essay too much. Don\'t let other people write your essays for you, because trust me, the admissions team can immediately tell if it is not written by students. While it is always better to write it on your own, it doesn\'t mean you can\'t ask for other people\'s help. You can ask your parents or teacher for feedback, or even get coaching from a professional, like here at ALL-in Eduspace!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Overly editing</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Before submitting to Common App, your essay needs to be reviewed by someone else for clarity, grammar, spelling, and punctuation. As you get a lot of feedback on your essay from different people, you will have the tendency to edit it over and over again to make each of your readers happy. Please do not do this! Out of all the suggestions that you received, you still have to maintain your own voice in the essay. So don\'t receive all the feedback and blindly make the changes in your writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hone your writing skills and ace your Common App essay!

Established in 1869, UC has grown to include over 280,000 students and 227,000 staff and faculty members. Is attending one of the UC Schools your dream? If that\'s the case, be ready to explore what it takes to get into the most prestigious UC schools. Check out these pointers to save yourself a seat at one of the well-regarded UC campuses by nailing the admissions!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>All-in-one application</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With their own application system, <strong>My UC Application</strong>, you can apply to all nine UC schools. This means that when applying to UC Schools, you won\'t need the Common App.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be aware that for every UC school you apply to requires its own <strong>$80 application fee.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each school to which you apply considers your application <strong>independently</strong>, therefore the decision of one school will have no influence on the decision of another. Each campus will assess your application without knowing the status of your application at other campuses.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Standardized-test-blind approach</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The University of California Board of Regents unanimously decided in <strong>May 2020</strong> to no longer require the ACT and SAT as part of admissions and scholarships applications up <strong>until Fall 2023</strong>. Simply put, your ACT or SAT scores will not be required to submit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision has been in the works for years, with the goal of improving the fairness of the admissions process for students. However, test scores may be used for reasons other than admissions, such as course placement, but only after you have enrolled in a UC school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A UC-specific standardized test is now in development, and it is possible that it will replace ACT and SAT scores <strong>after 2025</strong>, but this has yet to be confirmed.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Broad academic areas&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>At the UC campuses, STEM, the humanities, and the social sciences are all considered as strong fields. Nevertheless, the nine UC campuses provide over 850 degree programs and 160 academic areas, so any major you choose is likely to be offered at one of the UCs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each UC school has its unique set of academic strengths. For instance, UCLA is known for its Psychology program, while UC Berkeley, home of 10 Nobel Laureates, excels in their STEM programs. UC Riverside, which is ranked 88th in the US News & World Report 2021, has one of the most prestigious entomology and agriculture departments. UC Santa Cruz, on the other hand, boasts one of the best marine biology programs in the US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Easiest UC School to get into</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 2005, UC Merced is the easiest UC School to get into. You can get into the first American research university of the 21st century with an acceptance rate of <strong>72%</strong>. As it is still a newer school, UC Merced has a much smaller enrollment than other UC Schools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a 57% acceptance rate, UC Riverside ranks second as the easiest UC School to get into. It is also noted for being a very diverse school that welcomes all students.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Hardest UC School to get into</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>UC Berkeley and UCLA are the most competitive of the UC colleges, with acceptance rates well <strong>below 20%</strong>. Both campuses are the most selective and well-respected of the nine UC campuses.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the low acceptance rate, there are a number of solid reasons to apply. One of them is the location, with Berkley standing about a 20-minute drive from San Francisco while UCLA lying in the heart of Los Angeles. With these prime locations, students could gain greater access to a number of internships and job opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Preparing for UC admissions?

(8904, 'the-pomodoro-technique-to-improve-study-session', 3, 0, 'The Pomodoro Technique To Improve Study Session', '<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>by: Claresta Audrey Tjandra</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Chances are you\'re bombarded with school assignments, group projects, and lengthy to-do lists. So, how can you get it all done efficiently? Meet the Pomodoro Technique, a popular time-management method invented by Italian Francesco Cirillo in his university days.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cirillo, like any other student, was struggling to complete his assignments and focus on his studies. He then discovered a tomato-shaped kitchen timer (pomodoro in Italian) to track his 25-minute work intervals, and the Pomodoro technique was born.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process is quite simple. When facing a large task, such as studying for your final exam, break your work down into short, timed chunks spaced by periods of rest. Why? Because taking regular breaks trains your brain to focus for short amounts of time, helps you combat distractions, and complete tasks in short bursts, while giving the break you need to relax and de-stress.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In five steps, here\'s how you can get started with Pomodoro:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Pick a task you want to work on</li><li>Set a timer for 25 minutes</li><li>Work until the timer ‘dings\' and record or take note of where you left off</li><li>Enjoy your 5-minute break - stretch, grab a drink, and stay away from your work</li><li>After four sessions of pomodoros, take a longer break of 15-30 minutes</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The key to the technique is the timer. Watching the timer wind down instills a sense of urgency. Instead of thinking you have endless time to get things done, you know you only have 25 minutes to make as much progress as possible on a task before taking a break.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consistently timing your activities makes you more aware of where your time goes and combats the time you got distracted. You\'ll learn to \"respect the tomato,\" which will not only help you manage your workload better, but will also help you cure that burnt-out feeling.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to start using the Pomodoro technique to maximise your productivity, here are some pointers:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1. Set aside one Pomodoro for small tasks</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You can combine simple tasks with others if those tasks will take less than one Pomodoro. For example, ‘set schedule for the weekend\', ‘read math class syllabus\', and ‘write to-do lists\' could go together in one Pomodoro session.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2. Experiment with the length of your pomodoros</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Different people work different ways to suit their needs. Writers, for example, go into a flow for an hour, whereas athletes practice in 15-minute bursts before catching their breath.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you feel that 25 minutes might be too long and can\'t get yourself to stay focused, you can try a 15-, 10-, or even 5-minute pomodoro. Try experimenting your intervals based on your available energy, the type of work or even the number of distractions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3. Practice, practice and practice!</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>On your initial attempts at Pomodoro-ing, you might be having trouble avoiding distractions and maintaining attention. But bear in mind not to give up as it\'s normal to find it difficult in adapting to the technique. After a few sessions, you\'ll eventually get used to the pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is the Pomodoro Technique for you? Try the Pomodoro Technique if you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Get easily distracted or love day-dreaming</li><li>Have lots of lengthy tasks that could take unlimited amounts of time to complete</li><li>Spend your time moving around from one thing to another</li><li>Constantly get exhausted or stressed out at the end of the day</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only from your Pomodoro sessions, but with ALL-in, you can also boost your grades and maximise your potential!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we can do for you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Maximize your university entrance prep with <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/admissions-mentoring/\"><strong>Admission Mentoring</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li><li>Explore your interests and dive into different industries on <strong><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/programs/passion-project-mentoring/\">Career Exploration.</a></strong></li><li>Improve grades and knowledge through <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/academic-test-preparation/\"><strong>Academic Tutoring.</strong></a></li><li>Upscale your personal brand on <strong><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/academic-test-preparation/ib-extended-essay-coaching/\">Writing Skills</a> </strong>improvement program.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s #TakeOnYourFuture with ALL-in Eduspace!

Whether it\'s presenting a presentation to your division, or typing up a database in Google Sheets, internships let you practice these skills in a realistic and professional setting.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Make Connections</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Internships always involve working with others in the company. Though interns normally don\'t get paid like other employees, this doesn\'t stop them from accessing the company\'s resources and network. A professional network is a very important aspect of your professional life, especially if you want to move up in your career. As students, a network can help you along the way of your <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/\"><strong>university application</strong></a> if you\'re still in high school or a better chance to land on your dream company if you\'re a university student. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Gaining valuable work experience&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Internship programs are often short, but they let you take a glimpse of what working in a particular field looks like. During the internship period, your daily routine will often mimic the full-time employees, thus you\'ll be experiencing every single little aspect of working in your chosen field. By knowing what it takes to work in a field like this, you\'ll soon begin to realize your likes and dislikes. This will help you in your exploration, especially when you still don\'t know what to pursue in university.&nbsp;This is one of internship benefits that you have to always remember!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Get new opportunities in advance</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The experience you get from an internship is valuable. With prior experience, you are deemed more skillful in the eyes of future employers, thus internships really can open new doors of opportunity as you move along. This is especially true in university-level internships where thousands of students are fighting for internship positions. With prior experience written clearly on your CV, you\'ll be put on an advantage compared to other students.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Gain financial compensation&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Though most internships are not paid, some companies offer financial compensation. This is one of many internship benefits that students love! After all your hard work, it\'s nice to know that your effort is valuable. This makes internships another great way to earn some extra cash for yourself while also helping you to become more financially conscious and independent. But remember, don\'t join an internship just for the money, but instead focus on the experience you\'ll gain. Some internships in big organizations like NASA and Microsoft are even designed to boost the interns\' professional and technical skills.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just 5 of the many benefits of internships.

How you do your activities in or out of school such as extracurriculars, community services, sports or arts, part-time jobs or internships, are also matters in your application. Explaining these activities into your portfolio shows your drive and passion, and soft skills such as leadership and time management that will add to your value in the admissions team\'s eyes. Therefore, you need to make sure that you are having your profile constructed into a strong portfolio! This article will tell you some tips you need to pay attention to during your college application portfolio.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Create Coherence</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be better to show that you are focused and have your activities aligned with each other and if possible, match with the major you want to take later. Instead of putting many random activities in various fields, it\'s better to list down two to three activities with the same theme that you were dedicated to. This helps to show your growth and consistency to the field that you have interests in. For example, if you love science, you can take part in school science projects or competitions, and maybe add your community services act such as volunteering to be science tutor to younger children. Community service could also add to your portfolio, as the admissions officer who sees this will not think that it\'s not just a way to pad a college application, but to also show your desire to give back to the community.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Make It Unique</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to make your portfolio stand out to be remembered. If you worked on a project, did an interesting internship, or committed to an unusual activity, include it in your application. Submit your additional material that points out your accomplishments if there\'s any. Make the activities sound as impressive as possible. Write down the skills and achievements that you acquired and what impact that you brought while doing them. It will also be a bonus point if the activities influenced your ambition for college. Be sure to display your talents in a way that people would love to know more.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Show Interests and Passion</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but not the least, you really need to show that you are not just following your peers\' activities or what your parents push you to do. You have to engage in activities that actually reflect your own passion. You are developing a distinct set of interests through your adolescence. Start building your portfolio effectively if you focus on finding your interests and passion from a young age! To explore it, you can engage in projects or immersion programs. You can join the Experiential Learning program from ALL-in Eduspace to explore your interests that could help you to find your dream career.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, are you ready to start building your college application portfolio?

(9081, 'what-is-ucas-guide-to-study-in-the-uk', 1, 0, 'What is UCAS? Guide to Study in the UK ﻿', '<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>by: Saeka Minami Kalpika</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, if you\'re currently planning to study in the UK, you probably have heard about UCAS. UCAS stands for Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, a centralized service for students to apply for undergraduate programs to the universities in the UK. In 2021, UCAS processed almost 3 million student applications to universities and colleges across the UK for both local and international students. If you want to know how to submit your application through UCAS for your application to study in the UK, read more on this article.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How to submit</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To apply through UCAS, you have to go to their ‘Apply\' section <a href=\"https://2021.undergrad.apply.ucas.com/appreg/SecurityServlet\">here</a>. There are seven sections you need to complete:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Personal details</strong></li><li><strong>Student finance</strong><br>UCAS will ask you on how to fund your studies.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Choices</strong><br>You can choose up to five courses or programs per application. This can be five same courses at five different universities, or five different courses all at the same university or any combination of them.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Education details</strong><br>Enter all your qualifications from secondary education onwards. This helps the universities of your choice to know if you meet their entry requirements.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Personal statement</strong><br>You will need to submit a personal statement. It\'s got to be at least 1,000 characters long – but you have up to 4,000 characters/47 lines – whichever comes first. Write what you want to tell the universities why you\'d like to study with them, and what skills and experience you have.</li><li><strong>Employment</strong><br>You can input details for up to five paid working experiences if you\'ve had one, whether it\'s a full time or a part time job.</li><li><strong>Reference</strong><br>Submit a written recommendation from your teacher, adviser or professional who knows you academically.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>After completing these sections, you need to pay for the UCAS application fee. If you\'re applying to study in 2022: £22 for a single choice, or £26.50 for more than one choice. ​Once you have submitted your UCAS application, universities will consider your offer before informing you of their response.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>UCAS Tariff Points</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tariff Points (previously known as “points system”) is a way to compare students as equitably as possible. It translates your qualifications and grades into a numerical value, and some universities, colleges, and conservatoires refer to UCAS Tariff points in their course entry requirements. But not all qualifications are on the Tariff, so don\'t worry if you can\'t find your qualification, as a university, college, or conservatoire may still accept it. Therefore, you always need to make sure of your intended university entry requirements carefully. If you want to calculate your tariff points, check your grades on the <a href=\"https://www.ucas.com/ucas/tariff-calculator\">UCAS Calculator</a>.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>When to submit</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The UCAS application deadlines are fixed, and you need to pay attention to it because late applications will not be considered. The deadline will depend on the university and course you are applying to. For most universities and courses, the deadline is January 15th each year, but if you\'re planning to apply to Oxbridge and some specific courses, an earlier deadline applies. Make sure to have your time table ready so you will not miss the deadlines!&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can only apply through UCAS once a year, so it\'s very important to ensure that your overall application is relevant. From the official UCAS site, here are the top things admissions teams will look for when reviewing your application:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Qualifications</li><li>content of written personal statement displaying passion for the subject area, while demonstrating motivation, enthusiasm, and the skills and experiences that will enable you to succeed at university</li><li>content of reference</li><li>knowledge of, and commitment to, the subject discipline</li><li>good attitude to learning and personal development</li><li>ability to articulate yourself fluently and accurately in writing – it is a sign of what\'s to come for tutors</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So, are you ready to start your journey to study in the UK?

(9085, 'sat-act-should-i-prepare-for-it', 3, 0, 'SAT/ACT, Should I Prepare For It?', '<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>by: Calysta Aurelia Tesiman</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In the wake of the novel Coronavirus pandemic last year, many US universities adopted the Test-Optional policy which allows applying seniors to choose whether or not to submit standardized test scores. As this year\'s application season is coming around the corner, many schools are planning to implement Test-Optional policies for this year and the following years to come. Now you might be wondering: Should I still prepare for the SAT/ACT? Keep reading to find out.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What is Test-Optional Policy anyway?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the name, <strong>Test-Optional</strong> Policy lets applicants choose whether to submit their SAT/ACT scores. This policy came to be due to the pandemic as not a lot of students are able to sit for their exams due to government regulations on social distancing and COVID-19, thus giving disadvantaged applicants an equal chance in the application process. When you submit your test scores, the admission officers will then take into account your test scores, but may focus on other aspects of your application.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some schools like the University of California schools even applied the <strong>Test Blind</strong> policy, which means that admission officers will completely ignore any standardized test scores submitted by an applicant. This means that the admission officer will solely focus on other aspects of your application like Extracurriculars, Essays, and school transcripts.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, some schools adopt the <strong>Text Flexible</strong> Policy which allows you to submit any test grades that are relevant to your application. If you didn\'t do so well in the SAT, you can opt to submit another exam where you scored better.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>I\'ve taken the SAT/ACT, what now?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\'ve taken the SAT in the past and you\'ve scored well, that\'s great! Though you have a choice to submit or not, it\'s better to submit your scores. This will help you create a more “complete” application and gives the admission officers the idea that you were well prepared for the SAT/ACT.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>I\'ve not taken the SAT/ACT, should I still do it?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\'ve not taken the SAT/ACT, you are probably wondering if you still need to prepare for the SAT/ACT and sit for the tests. The truth is, even if many schools are test-optional this year, this doesn\'t mean that you can\'t still maximize the opportunity to boost your application. If you still have time, consider preparing for the SAT and register for an upcoming test. Submitting a standardized test score would put you in a more advantageous position and boost your chance of admission.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that if you are applying to a <strong>Test Blind</strong> school, you need not submit your test scores.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>If I don\'t submit my SAT/ACT scores, will it hurt my chances?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the University that you\'re applying to doesn\'t require you to submit it, then your application won\'t be seen as lesser than other applicants. However, submitting the SAT/ACT will definitely boost the competitiveness of your application.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another added benefit of submitting your SAT/ACT scores is that your score can be used as added evidence for you to qualify for scholarships and financial aid. This means that preparing and sitting for the SAT/ACTs is definitely more beneficial in the long run.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sums up the Test-Optional Policy and answers some questions revolving around this new policy. As the 2022 Application season is coming around the corner, make sure you do the best you can to prepare for university applications to maximize your chances of admission.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to prepare for the SAT?

If you\'re one of them, it never hurts to learn how it works! Read more to know everything you need to know about the US higher education system!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>College vs. University</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These terms have given rise to a lot of confusion for a lot of students and parents. The truth is, in the United States, both terms are used interchangeably to refer to schools at the postsecondary level. Despite the fact that both institutions provide undergraduate education, there are key differences you should know:<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What Is a University?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Universities are public or private institutions that offer undergraduate and graduate degrees. As there are a larger number of enrolled students, these institutions generally offer a more diverse range of classes and programs. Private universities are typically smaller and more selective than public universities, which commonly enroll tens of thousands of students. For instance, the University of Florida, a public institution, enrolls more than 34,500 students, while Columbia University, an Ivy League school, admits about 6,200 students.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Larger universities frequently divide different academic areas of study into subsections of colleges. For example, UC Berkeley has its own business school, the Haas School of Business, as well as a school focusing on climate change and environmental justice, the Rausser College of Natural Resources.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What Is a College?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Colleges, as opposed to universities, typically have smaller student populations and fewer program options. The majority of colleges offer four-year bachelor\'s degrees, although some colleges, such as community colleges and junior colleges, may offer two-year associate degrees. In addition, there are some colleges that are actually universities but use the title ‘college\' as a university with the same name already exists. The College of Charleston, to exemplify, is a public liberal arts and sciences university that uses the term ‘college\'.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Majors, Minors, and Concentrations</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it enough that you\'ve decided on a major? Some colleges, however, do offer a number of concentrations and minors to support your degree.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters, majors are the areas of study you select to concentrate on. Psychology, chemical engineering, economics, and mathematics are a few examples. Majors usually represent your best interest when learning, which affects not only your academic track but also your career path. If you can\'t decide on just one major, most colleges allow you to choose two, also called double majoring.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Minors are secondary focus areas in addition to a major that is often offered by colleges as an optional way for students to pursue another subject without having to declare a second major. Minors usually require half the number of classes as majors, making declaring one a manageable commitment.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concentrations are specific areas of emphasis or specializations within your chosen major which are offered by institutions to allow students to dive deeper into a more specific area of study. In contrast to minors, concentrations usually must be in the same field. If you\'re majoring in business, for instance, a complementary concentration could be management, finance, or marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Basic requirements </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although different universities or programs have different requirements in submitting documents, here are some of the basic requirements you\'ll need to apply to US higher education:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Standardized Tests<ul><li>As an international student, you\'ll need to submit English proficiency test scores, this includes TOEFL, IELTS)</li><li>SAT or ACT</li></ul></li><li>School transcripts<ul><li>This means submitting your from every institution you have previously attended</li></ul></li><li>Essay</li><li>Recommendation letters<ul><li>You can ask your teachers who are familiar with your academic abilities or advisors who understand the kind of person you are to recommend you</li></ul></li><li>Copy of valid passport</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out more details about US university admissions, read: <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/study-in-us-heres-what-you-should-know/\">Study in US: Here\'s what you should know </a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Academic Year </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>US universities or colleges use quarters, trimesters, or semesters in the academic calendar systems. Generally, the academic year starts in August or September and finishes in May or June. The fall semester usually starts in late August or early September to mid-December, while the spring semester begins from January up until May or June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Grading System </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Grades</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Most US universities and colleges use the letter grading system from A to F, usually complemented with plus (+) and minus (-) signs. These grades are used in determining the GPA (grade point average) of the student. Some colleges, on the other hand, offer classes with pass/fail or satisfactory/unsatisfactory grades.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Credits</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Each academic term, students often take three to six classes, each of which is allocated a certain amount of academic credits, which typically ranges from three to five. The number of credits per class could be determined by the number of weekly hours of lessons. For instance, if you have a science course that meets for four hours every week, it will typically be worth four credit hours.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s the basic things you need to know about US higher education system!

(9172, 'working-in-the-us-as-international-students', 7, 0, 'Working in the US as International Students', '<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>By: Kenneth Sutedjo</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Working in the US is not as daunting as it seems! In the US, many international students feel a sudden dread toward their intended graduation date, because of the fear that they won\'t be able to find a job following graduation and are not ready to return to their home country. Understanding some of the challenges and working with some key tips and tricks will definitely make it easier.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Understand visa regulations</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With long-term employment playing a role in the consideration of employing new interns or full-time staff for a company, employers need to consider more things when looking at international students. For one, misunderstandings regarding visa status are extremely common, either from the students\' side or the employers\' side. These mishaps are minor, but can damage a professional relationship and hurt the chances of working in the US.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Working in the US</strong> for a long term</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason is the long-term employability of international students. Since technically these students are not US citizens, they will require a visa sponsor (which is usually a company) to act as a guarantor for that particular student to earn a permanent resident status. Oftentimes this process is lengthy, costly, and very unexpected, as employers only have a 30 minute window within the interview to decide whether or not a candidate is worth all of that. Above all, an employer is also concerned with the longevity of a candidate. They will need to ask whether the student is planning on staying long-term, or may think of leaving after 6 months to a different company after receiving permanent resident status.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Language and cultural barriers</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, there is also a concern over language and culture barriers. Despite putting on a good show in the interview and demonstrating strong language skills through a resume, employers may still have doubts on hiring international students because of cultural barriers. Having to acclimate to a new environment both in the US and in an individual company may be too overwhelming for some international students, and may cause inefficiency in work, management issues, and culture clashes. As such, employers consider this carefully as well when making the decision on who to hire.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tips and strategies</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With all that being said, there is never a sure chance for international students to get rejected out of the blue. Since you miss 100% of all the shots you don\'t take, it never hurts to give it a go. Here are a few tips and strategies to get started on the US job hunt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1. <strong>Research the situation</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Before walking in or even scheduling an interview with a company, it is always good to do some background research on the employers, and yourself. Glance over and take note of the company\'s values, vision and mission, and what they are looking for in a potential candidate. Then, introspect yourself and figure out your personal values, strengths, and how you can contribute to the company. This will help immensely in the application process and get you set up for success in the interview.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2. <strong>Network&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>More than two-thirds of jobs in the US originate from connections in the industry. It is extremely important to build relationships with employers, professors, and alumni in university to create a large professional network. Often it is easy to get to know professors through things like office hours, and networking events are usually set up to introduce alumni to current students. Whatever the occasion, be sure to network as often as possible, and it may end up being the reason for landing that next job.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3. <strong>Be persistent</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but not least, be persistent. The first 10 jobs you apply for may not even land you a rejection letter, and that is totally fine! As an international student looking for work in the US, it is imperative to be persistent and stay on the bright side of things. Being rejected means you now know which aspects of the job application to continue to work on, and get better for the next job application.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prepare for your career now with help from ALL-In Eduspace!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we can do for you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Maximize your university entrance prep with <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/admissions-mentoring/\"><strong>Admission Mentoring</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li><li>Explore your interests and dive into different industries on <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/passionxplorer/\"><strong>Career Exploration.</strong></a></li><li>Improve grades and knowledge through <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/academic-test-preparation/\"><strong>Academic Tutoring.</strong></a></li><li>Upscale your personal brand on <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/writing-skills/\"><strong>Writing Skills</strong></a><strong> </strong>improvement program.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s #TakeOnYourFuture with ALL-in Eduspace!

Before you can experience these, you must get through the application stage, which may feel like going into the unknown. No worries, as this article will cover how to apply to universities in European countries!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Germany</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.studying-in-germany.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/semester-abroad-in-germany.jpg\" alt=\"Germany Rated As World\'s Third Most Attractive Study Destination\"/><figcaption>Source: studying-in-germany.org</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Known for its high-quality and inexpensive education, it\'s no surprise Germany attracts tens of thousands of students. If you\'re on the search for the best-fit university for you in Germany, The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) is your best friend. It stores almost 2,000 programs available in German Universities, including 1,389 programs in English.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be admitted to a German university, you need to have a recognized Hochschulzugangsberechtigung (HZB), which means ‘higher education entrance qualification\' or equivalent. However, a high-school diploma, school-leaving certificate or university entrance exam result is usually sufficient. German universities commonly admit students depending on their high school grade point average (GPA). The higher the score, the better the chances of getting accepted.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can submit your application to the university\'s international office directly. On the other hand, you can also use the German Academic Exchange Service\'s (DAAD) website <a href=\"https://www.uni-assist.de/en/\">https://www.uni-assist.de/en/</a>, a centralised admissions platform for international students, albeit not all universities use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Netherlands</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d655b3b6f24eb12ba7b41d0?width=700\" alt=\"study in europe\"/><figcaption>Source: insider.com</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\'re planning to study in Europe, The Netherlands must be on one of your destinations. From its multicultural student environment to its innovative yet straightforward teaching approach, The Netherlands is home to more than 112,000 international students.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most programmes you first need to register via the Studielink. It is the official application portal for programmes at Dutch higher education institutions. However, bear in mind to always double-check with the institution of your interest, as some use a different approach to register international students!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to language requirements, Dutch universities are strict. As an international student you are required to submit a test of English proficiency. These include TOEFL, IELTS or a similar English language test.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Irelan</strong>d</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://images.ireland.com/media/Images/northern-ireland/6bdb0eb0771f4a2fbf4addb0a35268a9.jpg?w=1934\" alt=\"study in europe\"/><figcaption>Source: ireland.com</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\'re the type of person who loves nature, literature, or ancient history, Ireland is for you! Known as the continent\'s second largest island, Ireland is home to some of the finest universities in the world, with programs spanning between technology, economics, natural sciences, and the humanities.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When applying to Irish universities as a non-EU applicant, you must apply directly through the university\'s website. There are a few exceptions, in which specific programs may require all students, regardless of status, to apply through the Central Applications Office (CAO).<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As most Irish universities employ English as the medium of teaching, you\'ll need to submit one of the recognized English Language Proficiency Tests. Normally, an IELTS certificate is enough.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A special case is when you\'re planning on studying medicine in Ireland, in which you\'ll have to take the HPAT assessment test, which is an entry exam for medicine courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>France&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.campusfrance.org/sites/default/files/styles/mobile_menu_image_1_2_et_3/public/menu/2018-12/COM_Fotolia_190502221_Subscription_Monthly_XXL.jpg?h=04e1be11&itok=Kg0MCPgX\" alt=\"study in europe\"/><figcaption>Source: campusfrance.org</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>France never fails to attract international students with its high-quality education. Not to mention the modern yet sophisticated cities, and delightful French way of life.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For application to French universities, you can apply through “Campus France”. It is an organisation that helps international students with application, universities and visa to study in France.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With French as the primary medium of instruction, prospective students need to demonstrate proficiency in the French language through taking tests such as TCF, Common European Framework of Reference for Languages exam, DELF (Diplôme d\'Etudes en Langue Française) and DALF (Diplôme Approfondi de Langue Française). Not only that, some institutions require students to also take English proficiency tests, including TOEFL, IELTS, or equivalent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Studying in Europe comes with its pluses and minuses. On one side, you can hop on to other cities or countries easily with your passport. On the other hand, tuition fees are likely to be higher for international students.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>European universities, nonetheless, not only offer internationally recognized degrees, but also offer a variety of unique opportunities that you can\'t find in other places!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s go study in Europe!

So, which team are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>International Baccalaureate (IB)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like the name suggests - IB - International Baccalaureate is an international qualification that is almost universally accepted across the world.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>IB students typically take six subjects, three at a higher level and three at a standard level. Subjects that you need to take include first language, second language, Humanities, Sciences and Mathematics. The last subject can either be taken in the field of Arts, or be used to take one more subject in one of the categories.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IB Diploma Programme also includes core components, which consists of Theory of Knowledge (TOK), an extended essay (EE) and Creativity, Action, Service (CAS). The Theory of Knowledge (TOK) asks students to reflect on the nature of knowledge; the Extended Essay (EE) is a 4,000-word independent piece of research on a topic related to one of the IB subjects being studied; and Community, Action, Service (CAS) requires students to participate in a range of activities and projects that involves artistic, sporting and voluntary work.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For each of the subjects, IB grades range from 1 to 7, with 1 being the lowest and 7 being the highest. A student can get up to 3 bonus points if they complete the DP Core requirements which include the Extended Essay and TOK. These scores are all added together to give an overall score, with 45 being the highest possible grade. You need to reach at least 24 points to get the IB Diploma.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A-Level&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The GCE Advanced Level, or A-Level, is a secondary school-leaving qualification in the United Kingdom that is also recognized internationally. Although there is no limit to the number of subjects taken, most A-Level students focus on three or four academic areas studied in depth that reflect the direction they are likely to take at university level.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The A-Level program is divided into two ‘stages\' - AS Level, and A2 Level. AS-Levels are taken during the first year of studies that serves as a ‘foundation\' before moving on to the A2-Level, which offers more advanced coursework.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pass grades of A-Level are A* (the highest grade), followed by A, B, C, D and E. The overall A-Level score is taken from the average of the AS Level score and the A2 Level score.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s important to note that AS and A2 Level exams must be taken within 12 months of one another. Otherwise, the AS mark ‘expires\', and it can no longer be paired with the A2 mark to achieve an A-Level qualification. Furthermore, in AS and A2 courses, coursework or classroom participation grades have no impact on the final grade. Instead, the final examination scores determine the final score.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Key differences</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the distinct differences for both IB and A-Level that you should check out. Find out which international curriculum suits you the best!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>IB Diploma Programme</strong></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>A-Level</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Breadth-focus&nbsp;</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Depth-focus</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Graded using a points system</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Graded with letters</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">6 subjects taken (3 HL and 3 SL)</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Typically 3-4 subjects</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Can\'t really choose any combination&nbsp;</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Flexibility in choosing the combination of subjects</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Coursework heavy&nbsp;</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Theory based</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which one is for me?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision is definitely up to you, because both international curriculum have their own approach on education. A-Level is probably for you if you have a clear focus on a particular subject area and wish to explore a smaller range of fields in more depth. On the other hand, if you\'re still unsure about what major you want to study at university, the IB Diploma Programme is probably better as it provides variety in your subjects and allows you to have contact with different areas of knowledge.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, if you are set to study in the UK, the A-Level is preferred as it is the ‘home\' high school qualification. If you don\'t necessarily intend to attend a university in the United Kingdom, the IB Diploma Programme is a better option as it is an international program that is recognized in nearly 90 countries and actively encourages a global perspective in study cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deal with the challenges and difficulties in IB or A-Level with ALL-in!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we can do for you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Maximize your university entrance prep with <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/admissions-mentoring/\"><strong>Admission Mentoring</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li><li>Explore your interests and dive into different industries on <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/passionxplorer/\"><strong>Career Exploration.</strong></a></li><li>Improve grades and knowledge through <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/academic-test-preparation/\"><strong>Academic Tutoring.</strong></a></li><li>Upscale your personal brand on <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/writing-skills/\"><strong>Writing Skills</strong></a><strong> </strong>improvement program.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s #TakeOnYourFuture with ALL-in Eduspace!

(9204, 'landing-a-career-in-usa-top-9-in-demand-jobs', 7, 0, 'Landing a Career in USA: Top 9 In-Demand Jobs', '<p>Have you ever wondered if your dream job is listed at one of the in-demand career in USA? With the world in constant transition, jobs continue to fluctuate in and out of demand. The rise of AI, automation, and technology has both given rise to new jobs in growing industries, while also replacing a portion of manual labor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In particular, the United States has seen a gradual shift towards more healthcare, technology, and service-driven careers. Some jobs, like Data Scientist are gaining much traction in the job market and are extremely popular. Others, like Mental Health Specialists, are more niche but growing in demand nonetheless. So what are the <strong>Top In-Demand Career in USA</strong> that will always be relevant in the future?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>In-home Caregiver&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As people move back to working from the office, the elderly at home will need someone to care for them. Especially in the US where 1 in 5 Americans are projected to be 65 years or older by 2030, <strong>in-home caregivers</strong> will step in as an in-demand career in USA.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These caregivers specialize in non-medical, intensive in-home care for elders. They assist with daily living activities like housekeeping, medication, and meal preparation. However, these do not necessarily translate to medical services, differing from nursing and therapists.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employees are expected to have a Bachelor\'s degree, but there are no requirements on majors. The salary range tends to fluctuate around $65,300 - $106,000 for caregivers. It is dependent on experience, skillset, and whether one freelances or engages with an agency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Digital/Social Media Marketer</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially with a growing digital audience, marketing becomes more competitive with global ad spending reaching $389 billion this year. This is why digital advertising will become a more sought out career in USA and around the world.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital Marketers are usually in charge of multiple channels that advertise a company\'s product. They usually manage multiple marketing channels and sometimes will also take over public relations and analytics reporting responsibilities.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The salary range for digital marketers is $48,000 - $96,000. Although a digital marketer depends more on transferable skills and content ideation, a Bachelor\'s degree is a good credential to have when applying for this job, even if the major is unrelated to marketing.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Nurse Practitioner&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The pandemic has increased the demand for nurse practitioners and medical professionals in general, as hospitals look to beef up their employment to withstand a higher concentration of patients.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While nursing may sound like a relatively easier job than being a doctor, it is not really the truth. They still have plenty of responsibilities that make a doctor\'s life easier. These include taking a patient\'s history, diagnosing diseases, writing prescriptions, and assisting in some medical procedures.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The salary range for nurse practitioners is easy $109,000 and above. However, a Master\'s degree in advanced nursing, a State license, and a national APRN certification are necessary for nurses to obtain before they can start working.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Software Engineer</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the digitization of advertisements and business opportunities, other fields are also eventually becoming more reliant on digital networks, computing systems, and new software. This is an especially exciting career in the US, where graduates can have the opportunity to work at Silicon Valley, the hub of technology and science in Northern California.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These engineers branch off from the field of computer science to apply their knowledge of programming, computer operating systems, and engineering principles to develop and build computer system software and applications. Software engineers usually cater to a client\'s needs when developing software. They make sure to incorporate company values and culture into their work as well.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The salary range for Software Engineers is about $98,000, but can increase depending on how big a client\'s budget is. Typically, software engineers study a mix of computer science, engineering, and business.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>UX Designer</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The term UX is short for user experience and is particularly prevalent in web development or app development. This career only recently came around with the boom of smartphones and laptops but has been in demand ever since.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The responsibilities of a UX designer revolve around end-user experience. Designers want to ensure that the user of the software/app is utilizing the product by developers and the client\'s request. It is done through Design Thinking, market research, prototype testing, and other methods.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salary compensation for UX designers fluctuates around $80,000 to $103,000 depending on the size of the project and the impact of the software. Although UX degrees are not widespread yet, students can focus on learning about psychology, marketing, technology, and design to gain the necessary skills to become a UX designers.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Genetic Counselor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The future of biotechnology and genetics in the US will grow by 26% through 2030. These careers aim to counsel individuals or families on inherited conditions, genetic disorders, and birth defects.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Genetic counselors typically work at university medical centers, hospitals, diagnostic libraries, or physician offices. They might work with families, individuals, or partake in research and academia with other professionals.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, a Master\'s degree will be required to work as a certified counselor, along with appropriate national licenses and certifications. Possible majors to consider include Biology, Genetics, and Health Sciences. The average salary for genetic counselors is around $87,500 at an entry-level and could increase with work experience and promotional benefits.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Data Analyst/Scientist</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As industries spanning healthcare, finance, and education are all making use of more and more information, data is quickly becoming the world\'s most valuable currency.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data Scientists usually make use of large, unstructured data sets to analyze, process, and model data and create actionable plans for organizations. Often they are tasked with communicating complex ideas in a business setting and advising data-driven organizational decisions.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To become a Data Scientist, it is possible to pursue an undergraduate degree in either Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics, Statistics, or a closely related field. Learning key skills such as being able to use Python or Azure and earning certifications can also advance a career in Data Science. On average, data scientists can earn anywhere from $70,000 to above $120,000 annually.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mental Health Specialist/Rehab/Occupation&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the stigma of mental health is slowly being broken down, more people are coming out and admitting to having experienced some form of mental health problem in the past. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.thenationalcouncil.org/mental-health-month/\">1 in 5 adults and 1 in 6 youths in the US</a> suffer from mental disorders, a number that is seeing a positive uptrend in the coming decade.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With more demand for mental health specialists, these careers in the US have grown. Also working in the medical field, these specialists focus on working with patients to diagnose and provide treatment and advice for a variety of mental disorders.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A master\'s degree with more advanced training is usually required to become a credible mental health specialist, but generally studying toward an undergraduate degree in Psychology, Therapy, or Health Sciences could lead to a job in the mental health department. The average salary is about $50,000, but top earners can make up to $78,600.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cybersecurity analyst</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but not least, cybersecurity.

(9223, 'sat-and-act-4-key-differences', 3, 0, 'SAT and ACT: 4 Key Differences', '<p>Are you starting your university application to institutions in the United States, but can\'t figure out which standardized test to take? No worries, ALL-In Eduspace has your back! In this article, we go in-depth and discuss the structural, content, and logistical differences between the SAT and the ACT.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is SAT? What is ACT?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we go into the specifics, let\'s get to know these tests a little better. The SAT stands for the Scholastic Aptitude Test, but has since been dropped and just called the SAT as the test has evolved. It is administered by a not-for-profit company called CollegeBoard, which also administers Advanced Placement (AP) exams. On the other hand, the ACT stands for the American College Test, and is administered by ACT Inc., focusing mostly on the ACT as their main product.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we know what each test is, let\'s discuss some basic facts. Here is a quick comparison between these 2 standardized tests.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Category</strong></td><td><strong>SAT</strong></td><td><strong>ACT</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Total # of questions</td><td>154 questions</td><td>215 questions</td></tr><tr><td>Length</td><td>3 hours</td><td>2 hours 55 mins (without writing)3 hours 35 mins (with writing)</td></tr><tr><td>Scoring grade</td><td>Total 400-1600</td><td>Total 1-36</td></tr><tr><td>Order of sections</td><td>Reading&nbsp;Writing and Language&nbsp;Math (no calculator)&nbsp;Math (with calculator)</td><td>EnglishMath&nbsp;Reading&nbsp;Science&nbsp;Writing (optional)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With that, let\'s discuss <strong>4 key differences</strong> between the SAT and the ACT. This will include questions, calculators, and evidence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><br>1. Total number of questions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As seen in the table above, the SAT has 154 questions, while the ACT has 215, quite a bit more. This means that without considering the optional writing section on the ACT, there is actually less time allotted per question for the ACT than the SAT, seeing as both tests take roughly 3 hours to complete. Here is a detailed breakdown:<br></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Test section</strong></td><td><strong>SAT</strong></td><td><strong>ACT</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Reading</td><td>75 sec/question</td><td>53 sec/question</td></tr><tr><td>Writing/English</td><td>48 sec/question</td><td>36 sec/question</td></tr><tr><td>Math</td><td>75 sec/question (w/calc)87 sec/question (w/o calc)</td><td>60 sec/question</td></tr><tr><td>Science</td><td>N/A</td><td>53 sec/question</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Our advice: </strong>If you are pretty good at time management, then go for the ACT! However, the SAT will be a better option if you are struggling in that department, especially if you need some more time in solving those tricky math questions.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. To calculator, or not to calculator?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While the ACT does allow students to use calculators in their math section, the SAT has a strictly no calculator section that spans 20 questions in 25 minutes, in comparison to the ACT\'s 38 questions in 55 minutes. Technically, all questions in either section of the ACT or SAT are solvable without a calculator, so there is not a big worry there. However, the non-calculator section does focus more on reasoning than arithmetics.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another note to keep in mind is the focus of questions. The math section in SAT tends to focus more on algebra and data analysis, where in the ACT there is a significant increase in geometry and trigonometry. The ACT also tests on matrices, trigonometric functions, and logarithms.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Our advice: </strong>If you are confident in your math abilities and are quite good at reasoning, the SAT would be a better choice to take. However, if you are better at geometry, trig, and logs, then the ACT would be your best bet!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Hunting for evidence</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you someone who is good at looking for clues and pinpointing certain phrases? If so, the SAT would be a great fit! Evidence-based reading and writing (EBRW) makes up a large part of the SAT English section and is completely absent in the ACT. This section requires students to read a certain paragraph from the reading, look for certain words/phrases that are important, and use them to answer questions. There are also certain situations where questions are interconnected, requiring the correct answer in the first before moving on to the second.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Our advice: </strong>If you dig the idea of connecting parts of a text to support an idea in the question, then the SAT is excellent for you. If not, then the ACT will be your go-to test for US testing requirements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><br>4. How will you be scored?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The obvious difference between the SAT and the ACT is obviously the scoring grade. The SAT has a total score range of 400-1600, while the ACT is graded from 1-36. The way in which these scores are determined are different, but both tests employ a “right-only” scoring method, where incorrect answers are not penalized, and correct answers are given scores. This means you should answer all questions on the test regardless if you know the answer or not!<br><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SAT is scored on the two main sections, which are Evidence-based Reading & Writing and Math. Both sections range from 200-800, and combine to give a total of 400-1600. On the other hand, the ACT is scored by an average score from all 4 sections.

Both home to many top institutions, the United Kingdom and United States are two of the most popular study destinations for international students. Despite this, they are actually quite different in the education system. If you are an International Student wanting to know more about the differences, keep reading to find out!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Decide the Length of Time</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Studying in the UK is considerably faster than studying in the US. A Bachelor\'s degree is completed in 3 years while in the States, it\'s usually 4. Moreover, it\'s not rare for undergraduate students who study in the UK to pursue a 4 year Master\'s degree while those studying in the US will have to go for another 2 years.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Understand the Education Structures</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Though both countries offer the range of majors that can accommodate each student\'s interests, how these courses are taught are a little bit different. In the UK, the course is taught in greater depth and <strong>specialisation </strong>which means that you\'ll only be studying the subjects related to your major. The US, however, offers more flexibility where students can take other subjects unrelated to their major. They also could graduate with a double major or a minor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>In addition, the teaching styles in UK vs US universities are also different. Studying in a UK university bases the final grade on examination performance. US universities consider participation, group work, and assignments alongside the exam to evaluate your final grade.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Comparing the Costs&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Higher Education is definitely quite pricey, especially for international students. This means that understanding the costs is an important aspect when considering where to study. Generally, US universities are considerably more costly than studying in the UK. Keep in mind that aside from tuition fees, additional expenses must also be taken into account.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, studying in the UK also comes with price tags. Not only do you have to pay for the tuition, you must also take into account living expenses which could be more costly in the UK. Accommodation fees often include on-campus meal plans in the US, while in most UK universities, most students will have to order from restaurants or cook in their accommodation.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Application Process&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know the differences about studying in the UK and US, it\'s time to delve into the application process. Not surprisingly, the application process to study in the UK and US are completely different.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To apply to the UK, you must apply through the <strong>UCAS </strong>platform. They only allow students to apply to a maximum of 5 Universities/Programmes through the <strong>UCAS</strong> portal, so be aware of the offer requirements and remember to shortlist your university list to 5.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\'re applying to the US, you have to complete your application through the <strong>Common App</strong> or the university\'s own website. You also need to submit a variety of official documents and essays. Because of this, applying to the US is much more complicated than applying to study in the UK. To read more about how to apply to US schools, read our article about Studying in the US.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are some of the differences between studying in the UK and US. If you\'re still choosing between the two countries, make sure you consider these differences based on your preferences and plans. If you\'re confident that you want to study in either country, make sure you do further research!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to study in the US or UK?

When it comes to choosing a major, things could be tricky. Especially if you have many interests and dream jobs you want to achieve in the future. Apparently, a survey from BestColleges in 2020 finds that most college graduates would change majors if they could. You don\'t want this to happen, right? So make sure that you have gone through 5 key factors to consider in choosing a major. Read more to find out!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. Goal</strong>s</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask yourself, why do you want to go to university in the first place? Is it to chase potential careers, or learning things you\'re skilled at in a more advanced way? Some students pursue majors based on job demand and salary potential. Others are taking it because they\'re passionate about and want to hone their skills in certain fields. Think about three factors: economic advantage, interest level, and ability that are most important and relevant to you!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><br><strong>2</strong>. <strong>Interest & Passion</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your interest and passion should be one of the first things to remember when you choose a major. It is important to have an interest in what you\'re studying. If not, then you will not have the motivation or drive to complete your coursework. Majoring in something you love will make studying and learning easier, and of course much more enjoyable. Now, think about things that you like. For example, if you are interested in investment, wealth management, and things related, you can consider taking a Finance or Business major.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Abilities</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than thinking about things that you like, you have to also think about things that you\'re good at. The second factor you\'ll want to consider is where your talents lie. Choose major based on your abilities. This way, it\'ll help you to be confident to do well on your coursework. To see which academic fields best suit you is to take a close look at your grades in high school, as well as your ACT or SAT scores. By looking at this, you can take your strength and interest to pick the right major.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. Career goals</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you want to be when you grow up? This certainly has been going on in your mind since the beginning. It makes sense to consider what kind of job prospects you will have once you have your degree. You can ask yourself, what kind of job do you want to land? What are the major options to support you in achieving that career? Checking on the job\'s salary potential or what you can contribute in doing the job could also help you.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>5. Coursework</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Different majors require different types and loads of tasks to complete. Some majors may feel harder than others based on factors like typical homework load, course expectations, and frequency of exams. Before you pick a major, make sure to understand the workload that will be there. But remember, this shouldn\'t back you down from things you want to learn! Take this as a challenge that you need to pass in order to succeed.

(9233, 'college-application-profile-tips-and-tricks', 1, 0, 'College Application Profile: Tips and Tricks ﻿', '<p>By: Calysta Tesiman</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>College application profile is something that you need to pay attention as stellar grades won\'t be the only way to be accepted into top universities. As the years go by, the number of college applications multiply which makes admission to selective universities more difficult. With acceptance rates of many top universities shrinking into single digits, it\'s important to craft a strong college application profile which can boost your chances of getting admitted. Keep reading to find out how you can craft a strong college application profile to reach your dream university!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Keep those grades up!</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In a gist, Your College Application profile highlights your academic capabilities to pursue further education. That\'s why almost all universities require you to submit your high school transcript. Having good grades is extremely important, especially if you\'re applying to top universities as most of the other applicants have excellent academic performance. Having poor academic performance would really jeopardize your application and have it sent to the “Reject” pile.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Craft your Unique Selling Point (a.k.a Your Personal Brand)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A Personal Brand is defined as 2-3 sentences about yourself that you\'d like the admission committee to remember about you. It is actually one of the most important aspects of your college application profile. A Personal Brand should reflect your own academic interest as well as your personal qualities. To build a good Personal Brand, you should really explore your interests and step out of your comfort zone. You can join (or even better: lead!) clubs, internships, competitions, and volunteering. These could help you decide what your interests are. Remember that your Personal Brand should be unique to YOU, so make sure you take time to really explore your interests.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Go for the Extra Mile&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the numbers of applicants with stellar grades and varied extracurriculars increase, it\'s important to stand out by “running the extra mile”. If you\'ve joined competitions, work hard to achieve significant accomplishments in them. If you want to excel in your admission interviews, read books, do online courses and try to form your own educated opinions after you\'ve learned something new. These are some of the infinite ways you can show to your admissions officer that you are resourceful and will go beyond what is expected.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Write a killer essay</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your admission essay/personal statement is just as important as your grades as an essay lets you highlight your personality and values. Admission officers want to know that you are not a two dimensional applicant who just studies. They need to know a complex character who cares about their community and has niche interests. Though essay writing may not be everybody\'s forte, remember that there is no such thing as the perfect essay. You can always write it closer to perfection by starting as early as possible. Don\'t do it last minute, instead spend some time thinking about how to express yourself best.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Connect with alumni and professors&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Though this isn\'t as important as the other aspects, it\'s still great if you can reach out to alumni and professors. Reaching out to people will not only expand your network, but it will also access resources or advice from people within your dream institution. Moreover, connecting with professors from your dream university may even improve your chances of being accepted.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Be Yourself&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, and most importantly, be yourself. The best version of you is the version you embrace wholly and are proud of. Don\'t try to follow what your peers are doing instead do things because you like it. Don\'t force yourself to study a subject if you hate it. Instead, focus on the subjects you enjoy and do well in them. Not being yourself will reflect as a lack of passion in your college application profile, which diminishes the confidence of admission officers to accept you.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just a few tips on how to craft a strong college application profile.

It\'s got to be at least 1,000 characters long – but you have up to 4,000 characters/47 lines –. In this personal statement, you can write what you want to tell the universities why you\'d like to study with them, and what skills and experience you have.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we will tell you what to write and how to write UCAS personal statement to make sure you can appeal in the admissions team\'s eyes of your dream university!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What to write</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that you are already aware of a personal statement.

Remember that you can only write one personal statement in your UCAS application. That\'s why you have to avoid naming specific university names. If you\'re planning on applying to similar subjects, try not to mention course titles and write about the subject in general.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three main things you need to remember to write: your qualities, your goal, and your suitability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>1</strong>. <strong>Your Qualities&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the course description thoroughly, and the requirements to enroll in one. You can identify the qualities, skills, and experiences that are needed to decide on what to write about.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><br><strong>2</strong>. <strong>Your Goal</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Explain the reason why you\'re applying.

(9253, 'profile-building-why-is-it-important', 1, 0, 'Profile Building, Why Is It Important?', '<p>Since the beginning, students are always obliged to get perfect scores in their exams. That\'s why nowadays, having perfect scores on standardized tests and stellar grades alone are not the only important criteria to apply for overseas universities. The admission teams have taken a different approach to pick their applicants, which is by looking at their <strong>profile</strong>. Applicants are expected to have something that shows uniqueness to stand out among many applicants. This is why building your own profile is important. So, have you started on profile building yet?<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What is Profile Building?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Profile building is a process of developing projects and skills that could be showcased on your CV. Every activity done to raise awareness of your expertise, skills, achievements, and commitment to advance your career and educational goals is a way to build your profile.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Why is it important?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Building your profile is not something that you can do overnight. It requires a lot of exploration, time, and strategy to pour it down into an outstanding resume.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><br><strong>New testing method</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As students aim for outstanding academic performances, it is difficult to differentiate which candidates are the best fit for the program and university they\'re applying into. Therefore, having good grades sadly does not guarantee your admission. University admissions boards have their own new testing method through interviews to showcase your profile. Some are focusing on how you prove your creativity and leadership skills. Others are looking if you really have the interest in the field that you\'re applying into.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Checking on commitment</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s important to make your interest and skills become something that could contribute to society. Your interests will not get the best exposure if it\'s only expressed through a hobby. Make it become your achievements by certifying them. Therefore, you can show your interest in a legitimate way that could help you land admissions on majors you favor. There are many activities that you can do to build your profile.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Time-sensitive</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We always, always strongly suggest you to start building your profile as early as possible. Time waits for no one! You don\'t want to build your profile at the last minute and risk not having your profile strong and unique enough. <strong>9th grade </strong>is the perfect time to start exploring your interests! Then you can start engaging in activities that suit your interests&nbsp; throughout high school.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Activities for profile building</strong><br></h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>1.<strong>Research&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that catches your attention, take a step further to know more. Create a research project based on your interests. You can team up with friends that have the same passion as you and ask your teacher to guide you through the research.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><br><strong>2</strong>. <strong>Internship</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In high school, there is plenty of time to complete part-time at school and full-time internships on your holiday. Take advantage of this fact to create a resume, apply for a company and find an internship&nbsp; that suits your area of ​​interest. Not only will you build your profile, but you can also expand your network by doing internships!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3. <strong>Volunteering</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In a 2018 <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereknewton/2018/04/05/new-survey-shows-value-of-community-service-in-college-admissions/?sh=3f2220653d3a\">survey of 264 US admission leaders,</a> 58% of them said they agreed that, “A student\'s community service experience has a positive impact on his or her acceptance to our higher education institution.” Volunteering is important because it adds to the overall roundness and reflects your commitment to the community. It could also increase the chance of getting a scholarship!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><br><strong>4</strong>. <strong>Competition</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>By regularly joining competitions or even winning it, will help you create an excellent profile. This shows your beyond-academic abilities which admissions teams look for. Participation in competitions shows your skills in problem-solving, presentation, teamwork, and project management.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>5. <strong>Personal Project</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of activities to be done by yourself.

However, studying smart is also important. Thus, knowing the proper SAT strategy that fits you will help you excel in the test.You may already be familiar with SAT, but let us explain it again. SAT stands for the “<em>Scholastic Aptitude Test</em>. It is administered by a not-for-profit organization called CollegeBoard, which also administers the Advanced Placement (AP) test. The SAT test used to be a required standardized test for university admissions requirements.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, since the pandemic, most universities have changed their policy on SAT score submission, making it becoming an optional requirement. While this may be the case, there is no harm in taking one. A strong SAT score can boost your academic profile, something that will differentiate you among other applicants who did not take the SAT. So, have you started taking a step on your SAT strategy? Here we have 6 things you can apply to your preparation to get that perfect score. Read more to find out!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Read and write more</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most effective way to enrich your vocabulary is to read everything. This will help you to practice on building your reading comprehension skill. As you read, you will come across new words, new styles, and new ideas that will help you in the SAT. Start from reading things that you enjoy, then challenge yourself to read more things that you find difficult or even “boring”. Once you\'re done reading, write and summarize it in your own words. Practice makes perfect. By doing this SAT strategy, your reading comprehension skills will get better and it will be easier for you to write!&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Learn from any materials</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it is books, online websites, YouTube videos, podcasts, or even simple Instagram feeds, you can learn SAT from anywhere! These materials can have anything from test-taking tips, practice questions, reading examples, essay prompts, and more. Learning from any materials is good and all, but if you have someone to guide you, your preparation would be even more perfect! Especially after having your diagnostic test and finding topics that you still need to work on. To help you with that, our mentors from <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/academic-test-preparation/\"><strong>SAT Preparation class</strong></a> are always ready to help you! In this class, we tailor learning materials and methods that best suit your needs.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Pace check</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know that every section in SAT only allows you to answer each question for not more than 90 seconds? It is a pretty fast-paced test. On top of that, you have to deal with graphics to interpret, lengthy passages to read, and determine which formula to use to solve the lengthy and confusing math word problem. You will need to manage your time to answer each question. To do this SAT strategy, always have a watch with you and do a test-run to know how long it takes for you to answer each question in each section.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a strategy called “the two-passes strategy” to help you with time-management. As explained by <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/\">Khan Academy,</a> it is a method you can use to structure your time strategically while working through a group of questions. It can help to ensure that you don\'t run out of time before you have had the chance to work on the questions that are easier for you. To do it, you can simply go through each group of questions that are easiest for you. After going through one by one, go back from the beginning and start to choose which problems to tackle in your remaining time.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Take diagnostic test&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking regular practices or diagnostic tests will help you to get accustomed to the test, both physically and mentally. You will know how it is structured, the questions that you will come across, identify which areas you are already strong at and the areas you need to work on. The diagnostic test result score could also be used as your starting point mark, so you can see how much you have improved through the SAT preparation. Do you know that you can take the SAT diagnostic test with ALL-in? <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/allineduspacecontact\">Contact us</a> for more info!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Manage your stress</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is something that students sometimes forget, but it is actually an important SAT strategy. Manage your stress by starting preparing for it as early as possible! The feeling of being in control will lower the anxiety and give you confidence to face the test. While studying for the SAT is very important, It\'s also important to take a break and release the stress. Refresh yourself, eat well, relax, get a good night sleep, and be mentally and physically healthy for the day of the test.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, are you ready to face the SAT?

Tuition fees and living expenses could add up to around $60,000 per year. With this in mind, many international students consider partaking in the employment world to finance their education and living expenses. Working while studying can, of course, be beneficial to any student, as it will help them develop a solid CV and gain valuable experience in their field of interest. So, the million-dollar question is: Can I work and study in the USA?<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, yes! If you have been admitted to a university in the USA and have fulfilled all of the required steps, you will be able to study in the USA after your F-1 student visa is issued. Students enrolled in US universities, colleges, high schools, language training programs, and other academic institutions are eligible for the F-1 visa category.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Work and Study in the USA with F-1 Visa</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As an international student with an F-1 visa, you are allowed to work on-campus and in specified training programs. During your first academic year, however, you can only to work on-campus for up to 20 hours per week when school is in session, and work full-time during school breaks for up to 40 hours per week. On-campus employment refers to work that takes place on campus or at a school-affiliated off-campus location. That could mean working in the library, dining area, administrative offices or other facilities where students can help.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After completing at least one full academic year, you can gain employment off-campus as an F-1 student through programs specifically for international students. These include Optional Practical Training (OPT) and Curricular Practical Training (CPT).<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Optional Practical Training (OPT)</strong> </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OPT is work authorization for F-1 students to work temporarily up to 12 months in areas that are related to their major for up to one year either before or after they graduate (pre-completion OPT or post-completion OPT). F-1 students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) may apply for a 24-month extension of their post-completion optional practical training (OPT).&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Office of International Services (OIS), students are eligible for 12 months of OPT for each level of higher education completed. This means students can get the OPT authorization 12 months after completing a bachelor\'s degree,. Students can also get another 12 months after completing a master\'s degree.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Curricular Practical Training (CPT)</strong> </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CPT is a practical training opportunity where students can get experience in their field of study. CPT comes in a lot of forms: internship, cooperative (co-op) education job, a practicum, or any other experiences related to a student\'s field of study. Full-time students with an F-1 visa can be authorized for CPT if they fulfill two requirements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>An offer letter outlining the training opportunity in their field of study.</li><li>Registered for an appropriate course that covers the length of the training.&nbsp;<br></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>CPT is only available prior to the completion of a student\'s degree program. It may not cause a delay to academic program completion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, there are countless employment opportunities that you can land as an international student in the USA.

(9280, 'how-to-land-a-job-after-graduation', 7, 0, 'How to Land a Job After Graduation', '<p>After putting in the hard work and time needed to get a degree, the season to find a job that will make all those hours pay off has arrived. Finding a job in a competitive market is a significant transition that takes diligence and enthusiasm, and if you give out everything, you\'ll thank yourself later. The right job is out there waiting for you! Here are some takeaways to get yourself a job after graduation as soon as possible.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Learn how to ace an interview</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s never too early to work on your interview skills as interviews are so much more than your academic knowledge! You can run practice interviews with your friends, siblings or mentors to get yourself comfortable speaking as well as to improve your confidence. Another idea is to record your answer and then play it back to see what you look like and where you need to improve.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only that, you can also familiarize yourself with the company by researching their background or checking their website. Learning about the company will help you prepare thoughtful answers, and show that you\'re invested not only in the job, but also in the company you\'re applying to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Polish your skills</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Undoubtedly, getting a degree boosts your job prospects, but it\'s not the only thing that sets you apart from others. As well as gearing yourself with general knowledge about your field, employers are looking for practical and transferable skills.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In your university days, there are things that you can do to develop and hone your non-academic skills to make yourself attractive to prospective employers. Here are a few ideas for non-academic activities that you can take part in:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Voluntary work / Community service - From volunteering at a local nursing home to working in a charity, helping others in your own time gives you work experience while also giving back to the local community.&nbsp;</li><li>Event Organising - Whether it\'s a bake-sale or a campus halloween event, you can demonstrate organizational, time-management, and leadership skills while also having fun!</li><li>Governance/Student Body - Volunteering for student government exposes you to leadership and decision-making frameworks, as well as important actions such as campaigning, goal-setting, and representing people\'s interests.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Make yourself visible</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven\'t started networking, then what are you waiting for? According to a research conducted by LinkedIn, around 70% of positions are filled through solid connections, so ask around or talk to people about your professional interests, plans and aspirations as well as their advice and information on any job openings. You can schedule virtual appointments with individuals from your school, such as professors and career services professionals.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that many students have graduated before you, and they will have felt just as anxious about leaving education and entering the professional world. With that in mind, take advantage of your university community or alumni groups and ask them all of your career-related questions! This way, getting a job after graduation will be way easier because of the power of a network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Work on a stellar resume&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In today\'s competitive market of professional jobs, make sure you have an up-to-date resume. Your resume should not only displays all your achievements and experiences, but also what you can bring to the company. It\'s also worth noting that you can work on your profile on professional networking sites. You can use LinkedIn, or even build your own website. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\'t send the same resume to every job you apply for; instead, invest the time to research the company and the position you\'re applying for. Then, tailor your application to each one. A customised resume proves that you possess the skills the company seeks as well as reveals how you are a good fit for the position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remind yourself that getting into your dream university was not easy, but you achieved it.

Which means, you\'re one step closer to your university admissions. If you are preparing to study abroad, it\'s important for you to showcase your unique brand and achievements through your personal essay and outshine your competitors. If you are applying to Asian universities and still not sure how to start your admission essay, keep on reading to find useful tips to help you ace your admission essay for university!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Admission essay for university, why is it important?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Universities from different countries have different admission requirements, although your overall objective for your application is to be unique and to stand out from hundreds of competitors from all over the world. One of the main ways for you to do that is through your personal statement.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asian universities\' requirements regarding their admission essays do not have a big difference when you\'re applying to other countries. Their main goal is always to be able to see who you are as a person and if you are the right fit for their university. However, as each university has different aims in picking their candidates. It is critical for you to tailor your personal statement to the university you are applying to.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example, each application requirement in Singapore is different. One university may ask you to write a Statement of Purpose, another may ask you to write short essays as part of your application. To make sure that you are all prepared to ace your essay, here are a few tips to help you write a good essay:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Plan your essay well in advance</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Create a rough skeleton for the essay and jot down important details that you can include in your essay. This includes your background, significant experiences and achievements, reason of taking this course and choosing the university.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Show who you are</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The essay has to be highly tailored to fit in how your unique experiences have shaped you and your interests. You should be able to specifically address why your interests lie where they are. This can be done through an anecdote. It could also be your motivations and feelings about a certain topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Being honest goes a long way</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Mention your achievements and strengths in your voice and it is okay to not be overly positive. You can mention your setbacks and analyze how those situations have helped you grow as a person.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Be clear</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, always make sure that you don\'t overcomplicate your sentences. Your personal statement must be clear, coherent and succinct.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Check and recheck!</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Proofread your essay as many times as possible. Look for grammatical errors, sentence semantics and wordplay. And keep in mind the word count, to not exceed it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing that Asian universities have very high standards and pay great attention towards your scores, your essay will speak volumes about you as an individual. It is the most qualitative piece in your application, giving it a human touch to all the numbers and scores. Make the most of your personal statement to showcase your voice in your application.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p> Download “University Preparation Guidebook: Scholarship Edition” Guidebook to find out all the things you need to know before applying for scholarships.

It\'s essential to know how to prepare for IELTS because it\'s a well-rounded test that assesses your English proficiency through several sections, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Writing&nbsp;</li><li>Listening&nbsp;</li><li>Reading&nbsp;</li><li>Speaking&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So, figuring out how to earn a perfect score on your IELTS test? Read on to gain yourself some pointers on IELTS tips!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>IELTS Tips 1:</h3>\n\n\n\n<h3>Identify your weaknesses</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you develop a solid study plan for the IELTS test, start taking practice tests to help you establish where your strengths and weaknesses are. This is one of the IELTS tips that people often forget, but actually very important. Not only is it essential to improve on your weaknesses, but it is equally vital to develop on your strengths in order to lay a firm foundation for the IELTS test.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\'re a slow reader, for example, you might want to focus your preparation on the reading test rather than the writing, listening, or speaking tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>IELTS Tips 2:</h3>\n\n\n\n<h3>Get to know the test format</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing the IELTS test structure allows you to become familiar with the various segments and intricacies of the test so that nothing comes as a surprise during the test day.&nbsp;This is one of the IELTS tips that you really need to pay attention to!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The type of questions included in the four sections of the IELTS test are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Listening: Four recorded texts and speeches, with a total of 40 questions<ul><li>Types of question: multiple choice, matching, plan/map/diagram labelling, form/note/table/flow-chart/summary completion, sentence completion</li></ul></li><li>Reading: 40 questions based on three passages from books, newspapers, magazines and newspapers<ul><li>Types of question: filling gaps in a passage of written text or in a table, matching headings to written text to diagrams or charts, completing sentences, giving short answers to open questions, answering multiple choice questions</li></ul></li><li>Writing: Two tasks (writing in a formal style)</li><li>Speaking: A face-to-face interview made up of three parts</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>IELTS Tips 3:</h3>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do time-conscious practices</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The more you understand the test structure, the higher your chances are to complete it successfully within the allocated time frame.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conduct practice tests in the same time frame as the real test to familiarize yourself with the IELTS test and discover what it\'s like to take it so you can figure out which areas you need to work on while also getting accustomed to the pace of the test. The more time you spend practicing under pressure, the better you will be at managing your time.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The test lasts for 2 hours and 45 minutes, divided as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Listening: 30 minutes</li><li>Reading: 60 minutes</li><li>Writing: 60 minutes</li><li>Speaking: 11–14 minutes</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>IELTS Tips 4:</h3>\n\n\n\n<h3>Immerse yourself with English language into your routine</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Practicing for your IELTS test can start from your daily routines, for instance, you can conduct a casual study by reading English articles on the internet or listening to English podcasts to improve your reading and listening skills. These are simple habits you can do on your way to school, during your lunch break, or whenever you\'re free. Remember that studying for your IELTS exam does not have to be boring!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can listen to TED talks, or any podcasts with topics that catch your attention. You might read English articles in magazines or on the news. It makes no difference what the topic is as long as you\'re willing to listen and read! It\'s best to stick with something you\'re interested in rather than forcing you to study topics you don\'t enjoy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bonus Tip: Get yourself used with different English accents</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the British Council, you\'ll hear a range of accents during the Listening section of the IELTS test. This means that you\'ll be tested not only on your ability to understand one type of British or American English, but also on your ability to interpret accents from Canada, Australia, and even New Zealand.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When preparing for the tests, you can\'t get familiar with different kinds of accents by listening to just one or two audios only.

Lately, there have been various options available including IELTS, TOEFL, and Duolingo. While all serve the same goal in mind, namely to evaluate English language skill level in an academic setting, there are key differences to know.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Curious about the differences and the special features of each English proficiency test? Continue reading to find out!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>IELTS</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/IELTS_logo.svg/1280px-IELTS_logo.svg.png\" alt=\"Berkas:IELTS logo.svg - Wikipedia bahasa Indonesia, ensiklopedia bebas\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For non-native English speakers, the International English Language Test (IELTS) is one of the most widely accepted and well-recognized English language proficiency tests. IELTS tests are divided into two categories: <strong>IELTS Academic </strong>and<strong> IELTS General Training</strong>. The IELTS Academic test is for those applying for higher education or professional registration in an English-speaking environment, while the IELTS General Training test is for those who are going for secondary education, work experience, or training programs in English-speaking countries.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IELTS test includes four different sections:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Listening (30-40 minutes)</li><li>Reading (60 minutes)</li><li>Writing (60 minutes)&nbsp;</li><li>Speaking (11-14 minutes)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Questions found in the IELTS test consist of a mix of multiple choice, diagram labelling, matching, short answer, and sentence completion. The IELTS test takes <strong>about 2 hours and 45 minutes</strong> to complete, with the first three sections always completed immediately after each other and with no break. The Speaking test, on the other hand, is commonly done on a separate date.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>IELTS Grading System</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The IELTS is graded on a <strong>9-point scale including half scores</strong>, with four subsection scores averaging out to give an overall band score. IELTS scores are accepted as proof of English language proficiency by almost all universities in the United Kingdom and Australia, more than 3,400 institutions in the United States, and the majority of academic institutions in Europe, Ireland, and Canada.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to COVID-19, <strong>IELTS Indicator</strong> was created, which is an <strong>online test</strong> that allows test takers to take the test in the comfort and safety of their own homes. This <strong>2 hours 45 minutes</strong> test is similar to the IELTS test taken in a test center in terms of questions and difficulty. It spans all four sections:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Listening (30 minutes) - 40 questions</li><li>Reading (60 minutes) - 40 questions</li><li>Writing (60 minutes) - 2 tasks</li><li>Speaking (11 to 14 minutes) - 3 tasks over Video Call</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The IELTS Indicator test must be completed in one session for the Listening, Reading, and Writing sections, with the Speaking test conducted via video call with a fully qualified and trained examiner a few days before or after the other sections. Within <strong>seven days</strong> of taking the test, test takers will receive an indicative score for each section as well as an overall band score. The IELTS Indicator is not a substitute for the in-person IELTS test as it only provides an <strong>indicative score</strong>. Therefore, not all organisations accept it, and once testing resumes, university or education providers may require the in-person IELTS test to be taken.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out which organisations accept IELTS Indicator at <a href=\"https://www.ieltsindicator.com/who-accepts-ielts-indicator-scores/\">https://www.ieltsindicator.com/who-accepts-ielts-indicator-scores/</a>&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>TOEFL</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/TOEFL_Logo.svg/1200px-TOEFL_Logo.svg.png\" alt=\"File:TOEFL Logo.svg - Wikimedia Commons\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The TOEFL is available in two formats: an <strong>internet-based test (iBT)</strong> and a <strong>paper-based test (PBT)</strong>, both of which are widely used for university admissions, employment, and immigration. Over 11,000 universities in over 150 countries recognize the test, which is graded on a scale of 120 points. The format of the test may vary based on the location of the test takers.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The TOEFL iBT has four components:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Listening Comprehension (54-72 minutes)</li><li>Structure and Written Expression (41-57 minutes)</li><li>Reading Comprehension (17 minutes)</li><li>Written expression (50 minutes)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Between the listening and speaking sections, there is a 10-minute break, making the test <strong>about 3 hours and 30 minutes</strong> long. Each section is graded on a scale of <strong>0 to 30</strong>, with <strong>120 </strong>as the maximum score. It usually takes <strong>six to ten days</strong> for the TOEFL iBT scores to be released. Both the iBT and PBT versions of the TOEFL test have the same four sections, but the scoring scales and timing are different.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Duolingo English Test</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The Duolingo English Test is an <strong>online test</strong> that can be taken from anywhere and at any given time. As it does not require an appointment, this test has become more widely accepted, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 2,000 universities already use this test for admissions, with 70% of them based in the United States. Even the most prestigious educational institutions have accepted it!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like the TOEFL and IELTS, it tests all four language skills:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Reading</li><li>Writing</li><li>Listening</li><li>Speaking</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Duolingo Test Format</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Duolingo offers a variety of questions in formats that may be unfamiliar to you. The tests includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Listening to spoken words and selecting the real ones</li><li>Reviewing written words and selecting the real ones</li><li>Completing missing letters from a text</li><li>Describing an image in writing or aloud</li><li>Recording yourself saying a written sentence</li><li>Verbally answering a spoken question</li><li>Responding in writing to a written question (writing samples have a maximum of 500 words but are usually much shorter)</li><li>Typing out a statement that you hear</li><li>Video interview - speak for 1-3 minutes on a chosen topic<ul><li>Ungraded but goes along with the test results&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within 60 minutes, the Duolingo English Test is divided into three parts:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Quick setup (5 minutes)</li><li>Adaptive test (45 minutes) - Evaluates Listening, Reading, Speaking, and Writing</li><li>Video interview (10 minutes)&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The test is adaptive in nature, which means that if a test taker answers correctly, the next question will be more difficult than the previous one. Conversely, if a wrong response is provided, the next question will be easier. As the Duolingo English Test blends all questions into a single exam, you can get a writing question following a reading question, for instance. The test lasts <strong>between 45 and 60 minutes</strong>, and is graded on a <strong>scale of 160 points, with 5-points increment</strong>. The test score will usually be released in<strong> 48 hours</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To check which institutions accept the Duolingo English Test, head over to <a href=\"https://englishtest.duolingo.com/institutions\">https://englishtest.duolingo.com/institutions</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Comparison </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Score comparison charts for all three - IELTS, TOEFL iBT, and Duolingo</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Proficiency Level</strong></td><td><strong>IELTS</strong><strong>	</strong></td><td><strong>TOEFL iBT</strong></td><td><strong>Duolingo</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Expert</td><td>9</td><td>118 - 120</td><td>155 - 160</td></tr><tr><td>Very good</td><td>8 - 8.5</td><td>110 - 117</td><td>135 - 150</td></tr><tr><td>Good</td><td>7 - 7.5</td><td>94 - 109</td><td>115 - 130</td></tr><tr><td>Competent</td><td>6 - 6.5</td><td>60 - 93</td><td>95 - 110</td></tr><tr><td>Modest</td><td>5 - 5.5</td><td>35 - 59</td><td>75 - 90</td></tr><tr><td>Limited&nbsp;</td><td>4.5</td><td>32 - 34</td><td>65 - 70</td></tr><tr><td>Extremely limited&nbsp;</td><td>4</td><td>0 - 31</td><td>55 - 60</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Key differences</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td><br></td><td><strong>Where do I take the test?</strong></td><td><strong>Test duration&nbsp;</strong></td><td><strong>Test Structure</strong></td><td><strong>How long would it take to get the results?</strong></td><td><strong>Validity of scores</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>IELTS Academic&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Test center</td><td>2 hours and 45 minutes</td><td>Four sections: Listening, Reading, Speaking, Writing&nbsp;</td><td>Computer-delivered IELTS: 3-5 days<br>Paper-based: 13 days</td><td>2 years</td></tr><tr><td><strong>IELTS Indicator&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Online&nbsp;</td><td>2 hours 45 minutes&nbsp;</td><td>Four sections: Listening, Reading, Speaking, Writing&nbsp;</td><td>7 days</td><td>Only provides indicative score for each section along with an overall indicative score</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TOEFL iBT</strong></td><td>Online</td><td>about 3 hours and 30 minutes</td><td>Four sections: Listening, Reading, Speaking, Writing&nbsp;<br></td><td>6 to 10 days&nbsp;</td><td>2 years</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Duolingo&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Online</td><td>Between 45 minutes and 1 hour</td><td>Three parts: Quick Set up, Adaptive Test, Video Interview&nbsp;</td><td>48 hours&nbsp;</td><td>2 years&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you\'ve known the differences between these three English language proficiency tests!

In the spirit of student projects, check out Abian\'s Solar-powered Automatic Dog Feeder project!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Abian Susatyo - Grade 11</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Seed Project (0-3 months)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Backstory of the Student Project</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Abian Susatyo, who has traveled around the world, has noticed the same problem in every place: numerous stray dogs roaming the streets. Stray dogs, like any other living animals, needed just as much food and drink to survive.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Initiatives</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Being an animal lover himself, Abian thought of a solution to make it more convenient for people who feed stray dogs. As a gesture of his gratitude, he came up with <strong>Solar-powered Automatic Dog Feeder</strong> for ALL-in\'s student project. Abian, who aspires to be a mechanical engineer, collaborated with his mentor Nicholas to create an automatic dog feeder that dispenses food at an adjustable period of time.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Project</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the span of three months, Abian has been working on his automatic dog feeder in his school\'s workshop. What started with watching YouTube videos on DIY dog feeders has progressed into the prototyping stage. Abian has gone through his third prototype.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the past few weeks, Abian has been researching the circuit aspect of his automatic dog feeder. Currently, he is creating some adjustments on the dispenser component of his automatic dog feeder prototype to make it compatible with the Arduino circuit.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what Abian\'s project looks like right now:&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DiNO_zUzmVryfWc64vckEPbX8V3QJCdpJ8IWFPA_T45pFd9jUN49TGFqZZxTL49uPV-TIoTdQg-0bKTKi5jHsenJNzm9q_8iHE41m1B2dU_8YSPYRglYWioJ72BKDvG8szCSUJiq\" alt=\"Student Project \" width=\"569\" height=\"758\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hYy_3XTvsXCl498S0DTNlQRuUiIrJ-YQ_qWwIazhfCDsAsk4of4sRrq6nL_CcZNFLs5wt42L82yQCnR6AFpJ7zXrL5X-xssNwwVvlVqmNEQPadybWPei67ls_dHNpexJYSlpdQ92\" alt=\"Student Project\" width=\"545\" height=\"969\"/><figcaption>The circuit component of Abian\'s Solar-powered Automatic Dog Feeder </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Future plan for Abian\'s Student Project</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even after Abian has only finished his first prototype, he has expressed optimism with his plan on starting a crowdfunding initiative for his project.

(9372, 'student-project-filtro', 5, 0, 'Student Project - Filtro', '<p>Creating a student project may require maximum concentration and thoughtful decisions. However, it could be a powerful teaching method for students. Student projects allow students to receive hands-on learning while building life skills such as critical thinking, self-confidence, and in-depth understanding. Speaking of student projects, let\'s discover Rayden\'s project of building Filtro!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ignacio Rayden Yap&nbsp; - Grade 9</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Unicorn ( 9-month ++)<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Backstory of Rayden\'s Student Project</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The start of the pandemic was faced with several problems. Sanitary kits were limited, masks were in short supply and irresponsible actors went on a hoarding streak. As a result, many couldn\'t afford sanitary supplies, particularly those who lost their jobs.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Initiatives</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rayden saw this problem, and decided to tackle any COVID-19-related problems by building his own company, Filtro. He has a vision on reducing the environmental damage of single-use masks while promoting a safer and healthier Indonesia.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Product</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Filtro is a business that produces and sells artisanal masks to Indonesian youth who are conscious of sourcing, production, and environmental sustainability. Their sustainably-produced masks are not only WHO-verified safe, but also use eco-friendly materials sourced from local stores.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a mission to give back to the community, 70% of Filtro\'s monthly goes to funding sanitary kits to donate. Filtro\'s sanitary kits include items like hand-painted masks,&nbsp; toothpaste, soap, and a bottle of hand sanitizer. Across Jakarta, Filtro has donated 50 to 100 sanitary kits monthly. Not just that, Filtro has also collaborated with other organizations for said donations, increasing them to 200 sanitary kits. In addition, Filtro has been working on the creation of sanitary stations to orphanages like Komunitas Anak Ceria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Progress of the Student Project</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For the past year, Filtro has faced impressive feats. Within the first 6 months, Filtro has partnered up with several charity organizations. Not just that, they have also collaborated with international schools, academic competitions, and donation initiatives. For instance, Filtro acted as a supplier for National High Jakarta School\'s \'English Week\' annual event. In addition, Filtro was invited as a collaborator in EduSummit 2021. It is a Model UN conference that involved the collaboration with other organizations as media partners.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Filtro is now on a hiatus on their social media page, their sales have not been affected.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Future plan</strong> </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rayden is currently focusing on UN Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 6. These goals are directly correlated to Filtro\'s prime mission, COVID-19-impact relief. After coming in second in the Ascend Now Bullpen, Rayden is fueling Filtro\'s growth phase through the seed fund. He is now developing new merchandise and implementing new donation initiatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rayden is planning on hosting webinars and seminars on educating the pressing conditions the community in Jakarta is facing. He thought of giving solutions to these issues while establishing Filtro\'s presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rayden\'s student project of Filtro is the winner of ALL-IN BEST PROJECT OF THE MONTH for December 2021 in the category of Unicorn Project!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let\'s hear what our judge, Eviana Misty (ALL-in mentor), says about Rayden\'s influential project:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“The project relates to the problem we are currently facing, Covid-19 and global warming. It already runs and proven to give a great impact with the ability to donate 200 sanitary kits from the sales. This project also has received many achievements including winning a competition and getting $1,000 investment.

For instance, if a blackout occurs, Mellvin can still continue his online classes using the energy generated from his project.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mellvin\'s project, with the support of his ALL-in mentor Nicholas, solved three problems all at once: keeping people fit during the pandemic, providing clean and renewable energy, and powering gadgets in case there\'s no electricity, all while addressing global warming concerns.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Product</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On building his electricity-generating bicycle that has been on-going for about 6 months, Mellvin uses a 2V alternator, 500W pure sine wave inverter, and a 12V battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what Mellvin\'s project looks like:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lTBObRbWp2cAbZ6LGpAyxBBbevgBj2qPxcMUKFqHIDC7kUc44vo0ybBW4YQL4TrFM9oo9VMfeVOLF8DiMZRVi13JbScYsyKD1OoBJtCa2qbXBlE-tdH4gH1VrVfETiedk2lvGpI6\" alt=\"Student project\" width=\"461\" height=\"615\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Future plans for Mellvin\'s Student Project</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mellvin realized that his project, while functional, has a size that is a little too long. He plans to redesign it to create a more compact and eco-friendly electricity-generating bicycle.

In spite of this, this nation has not use solar energy as its primary energy source. Brandon, Darren, Dylan, and Rayandra saw this problem, and turned this into an opportunity. They planned on creating a project of transforming solar energy into a good help in our daily lives.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Initiatives</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Right at the start of the project, they already have two goals in mind: developing a useful solar-powered product and spreading awareness about renewable energy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Product</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In developing a useful product, they focused on their daily lives. Brandon, Darren, Dylan, and Rayandra landed on a <strong>portable solar power bank</strong> after several brainstorming sessions.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After months of development, their first prototype was successfully developed. Although it\'s a simple product, it\'s useful as it uses the sun to power the portable charger.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards fulfilling their second goal of spreading awareness, PS2 members make use of Instagram. Their Instagram page (@powerourfuture) serves two purposes: a precursor to their main product and spreading awareness regarding renewable energy, its implications, and its potential in Indonesia.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what PS2\'s product looks like:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JbWjs1WA3aLUS4g8a2uj3O9m3Per05LgHgiN-YIGRUASPc98pRGGYZESw1R19SlUAp75ijpXTlKxNqQAkh_VWsMlCPAgn8L-bYpDMtc8ebeqhHVXes32qrz5SICZAKk-L1qDtC6r\" alt=\"Student Project\" width=\"434\" height=\"334\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/I-7h-XRIAqJ8No3nd0wgdG4b-LeFeNplLLTutEWFsEu9OvvQvKagZEtVA1-9Z6QMg9yOlXU2msYcvA9N4_d-u9fGXR7iT9UktmbGUIRiRXPpe6-rXICGI5BvINm7RJm-gQVkWeNu\" alt=\"Student Project \"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Progress of PS2\'s student project</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the span of nine months, PS2 members have already developed a working prototype along with their ALL-in mentor, Nicholas.

Studying abroad gives you the power to make meaningful connections, expand your perspective, and give you a competitive edge on the job market! When the world is your classroom, you\'ll gain an education like no other.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still not convinced enough? Here are four reasons to choose when your mind is thinking of ‘Why study abroad?\'&nbsp;<br> </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gain an edge from employers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In an increasingly globalised world, employers seek graduates with international experience and education. According to a survey conducted by The Erasmus Student Network, 92% of employers look for transferable skills that are typically gained from study abroad experience. These include:<br></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Communication skills - On your time abroad, you\'ll learn to overcome language barriers in a range of different scenarios. Furthermore, you can develop several key skills like negotiating and public speaking.</li><li>Independence - Studying abroad demonstrates the strength to take a leap of faith, adapting to unexpected situations, and solving problems on your own.&nbsp;</li><li>Project management - From navigating around a different environment to adapting to foreign transportation and different currencies, studying abroad builds your ability to plan ahead, manage your time, and think logically.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Enhance and build connections&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Why study abroad? For most students, this is their only opportunity to build invaluable relationships with people from all over the world. From exchanging stories to collaborating on a project with people from different cultures, you could broaden your connections while also building lifelong friendships. Some connections can even turn into career opportunities, including internships, job offers, and business partners!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Develop a global mindset and perspective</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In today\'s connected world, an open-minded approach and cultural awareness is essential. From your classmates to your professors, learning in an international environment challenges your assumptions and introduces you to different ways of thinking about the world. Gaining a variety of perspectives helps you view things in an entirely new way.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, you can get introduced to various educational settings. Adapting to various teaching styles can help you adjust to different management styles, making you more versatile in the workplace. Several teaching styles you may find abroad include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Authority Style</li><li>Facilitator Style</li><li>Delegator Style</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bonus reason of \'Why Study Abroad?\': Challenge yourself</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is nothing quite like being on your own in a foreign country. You may feel overwhelmed, but the challenges you overcome will help you grow into a more mature person. Remember that challenge = growth, which is probably the best one-word answer to the question ‘why study abroad?\'.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quickly adapting to your new environment will hone your self-reliance and resilience. From small and mundane tasks, like going to the doctor or setting up an international bank, to major issues, like learning how to negotiate with a professor or adapt to a different culture\'s management styles, your daily life can shape you into a more capable person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whichever country you visit, you\'ll never return as the same person. All those experiences will impact you for years to come. So, what are you waiting for?&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thinking of studying abroad?

What sets studying abroad apart is that it\'s more than just receiving the degree you yearn for; it\'s a whole package that catalyzes your growth, as well as ticking off your travel bucket lists and gaining hands-on learning!&nbsp; Find out four benefits of studying abroad that you might consider.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gain real-life experience to your classroom learning</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Several international universities incorporate in-the-field learning experiences to support and complement your classroom-only learning. Imagine studying art and then visiting the Louvre, or taking an Environment & Sustainability class and then going snowshoeing to monitor forests.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting hands-on opportunities not only allows you to get up close and personal with your major, but it also bridges the gap between theory and practice. This could help you to get your foot in the door before starting your dream job!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Explore the world</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Studying abroad is not a holiday. Exams, long-term assignments, and club events will fill your schedule. Nevertheless, any spare time you have can be spent exploring your new city; you\'ll learn everything about the local food, tradition, and history.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, when studying abroad, you are not limited to only one place; you can travel to nearby regions and countries. If you\'re studying in France, for instance, you can travel throughout Europe, including to Milan, London, and Barcelona. Who knows, your newfound friends might take you to places you\'ve never heard of!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A step into adult life</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Studying abroad could be your first time living away from home. Without your parents and families to back you up, your time-management and decision-making skills will be tested. From cleaning the house to staying on top of academics while seeking part-time work and financial budgeting – you have to master all these things fast!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, you\'ll grow in maturity in ways that you might not have at home. Ultimately, the benefits of studying abroad are not restricted to academic qualification or professional advancement; it\'s a life school as well.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Acquire new interests</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\'re still wondering about the benefits of studying abroad, you should know that studying in a different country exposes you to different activities that you have never experienced or heard before. Don\'t be surprised if you suddenly took up water sports, hiking, skiing, or many other new sports. You could attend a sports game and discover it\'s your new favorite.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key is to get out of your comfort zone, expand your horizons and jump into new things. Remember that studying abroad shouldn\'t all be about academics!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may never have considered the thought of studying abroad.

Though it\'s known to keep many IB students awake at night, the EE can be broken down into a manageable, doable process.&nbsp;Read on to know Extended Essay tips and tricks that can help you excel from Paul Edison, an IB examiner and ALL-in mentor!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Extended Essay Tips #1:&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Find the right supervisor&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great supervisor can not only help with finding the right topic but also cheer you on when your experiment fails for the sixth time. They will be able to point you in the right direction when you\'re stuck, and they can help evaluate whether or not your argument is critical.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your supervisor does not have to work at your school or even be your subject teacher. Sometimes, when given a choice between an overloaded supervisor with subject expertise and a smart, sympathetic supervisor with a manageable workload without the subject knowledge, the latter is the one who will be able to help you progress the most.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Extended Essay Tips #2:&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do a feasibility study</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing a thorough feasibility study before committing to your RQ will save you so much time. Make sure there are enough secondary sources out there that would help deepen your analysis before you choose to analyze that exotic foreign film. Before you commit to building your own energy reactor, make sure your school lab has the proper tools and materials to support your endeavor. Prior on conducting a massive city-wide survey on the impact of social media on teenage girls\' slang, make sure there\'s actually a noticeable linguistic shift.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spending an hour or two on feasibility studies might save you dozens of hours of research dead-ends and heartbreaks.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Extended Essay Tips #3:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Synthesize, not summarize!&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, obviously you\'d have to do both. But so often I see students do nothing more than paraphrasing various experts from their secondary sources.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, don\'t do this:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Professor A said that Jane Austen only appears in public at night, and Professor B said that Jane Austen is afraid of garlic and silver crucifix. Therefore, Jane Austen only appears at night and is afraid of garlic and silver objects.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, do this:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Professor A said that Jane Austen only appears in public at night, and Professor B said that Jane Austen is afraid of garlic and silver crucifix.&nbsp; This strongly suggests that Jane Austen is actually a vampire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Extended Essay Tips #4:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keep track of your secondary sources</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Even as you read through journals and articles, it will be very tempting to just jot down quotes and leave the citation for a later date. Do NOT do this. Otherwise, you might find yourself having to find the source of a particularly useful quote in the pile of 40-50 different sources.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Extended Essay Tips #5:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t sleep on your Reflection!&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seriously, so many students think that the reflection is just a formality. It isn\'t! If you look at the rubric, you\'ll see that Criterion E is entirely graded based on your three Reflection entries. These 500 words will determine almost 1/5th of your total score!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bonus Tip:&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dive deep into the rubrics</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For every subject, there\'s a specific way to interpret the rubric. Make sure you know what the examiners are looking for. Otherwise, you might think your essay is really strong while it\'s not actually meeting the criteria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Questioning how to write your IB Extended Essay is a common thing. With its complexity, many IB students find themselves puzzled and sometimes overwhelmed as well.

Back in November 2021, the trio decided to enter the Global Competition for Life Sciences (GloCoLiS) to fulfill their curiosity as well as their passion in the Life Sciences field.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What is GlocoLis?</strong><br></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>GloCoLis is an international-level Invention competition in the field of Life Sciences, which was the product of collaboration between Indonesian Young Scientist Association (IYSA), Indonesia International Institute for Life Sciences (I3L), Institut Pertanian Bogor, and the Faculty of Dentistry at Brawijaya University. With more than 100 participants, the competition covers six categories in the Life Sciences field: Bioinformatics, Biomedicine, Biotechnology, Food Technology, Pharmacy, and Food Science and Nutrition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, GloCoLis is a research paper competition which focuses on the topic of Life Sciences. In this competition, participants will team up into a group of five or less.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Competition Journey</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, Ariel, Qimiwa, and Amos didn\'t know each other. All of them have different interests revolving around the field of Life Sciences. Nevertheless, they tried to work things out, and ended up on joining the Food Science division. Upon finding the specific topic to work on, the trio share out and brainstorm several ideas with their ALL-in mentor and supervisor, Sharon.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, they settled on a topic: Association of Covid-19-induced Stress to Snacking Behavior in High School Students. According to Qimiwa, the topic they landed on appears&nbsp;to be a feasible one. This is because further research could possibly be done, especially during this time period.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a little over a week to work on their research paper, the trio\'s time management was put to test, especially with a lot of different activities they never did before. This includes learning to search and curate research papers, extracting information from past studies, constructing a survey, and processing the collected data.

These essay writing steps can guide you through creating the best essay that suits your needs, whether it is an essay homework, dissertation, or even a thesis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people can just sit in the corner of the room and start writing their essays quickly. On the contrary,&nbsp; a beginner might get confused about where to start and what to do. You can follow these steps to keep you organized and arranged as you write your essay.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Decide the types of essays.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing you can do is decide what kind of essay you are going to write. There are a lot of types which you can choose from:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Narrative Essay</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A narrative essay tells a story and imparts knowledge about a subject to the reader in a clear, ordered manner, similar to how a story is told.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Persuasive Essay</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A persuasive essay or argumentative essay is an essay in which you use logic and reason to demonstrate that your point of view is more valid than others. You must present clear arguments and back them up with convincing facts and logic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Expository Essay</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This essay style demands you to research an idea, analyze evidence, elaborate on the concept, and present a clear and concise argument about the topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Descriptive Essay</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of essay describes the subject to the reader in-depth. The purpose of this type of essay is to provide sufficiently specific descriptions for readers to visualize or imagine the chosen topic.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Research the topic.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you need to do is research your topic. The topic is the root of your essay. You can not write anything if you do not have any topic in the first place. Sit and write down any topic which comes up in your mind. Once you write it all down, you can narrow it down and choose the best one.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Develop the main point</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next phase is developing your main point or thesis statement. In this phase, you decide the basic premise of your essay. For example, the thesis statement might be “Electric is better than Gas.” Then, your whole essay is going to revolve around this idea. Make sure your thesis statement is general or broad enough to have more things to write.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Start writing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Begin by writing a thesis statement at the start of your writing, then a topic phrase for each paragraph preceding it. Creating these outlines implies that you should exactly know what each of your paragraphs will be about before writing. Make sure there are transitions between paragraphs so the reader can follow the writing flow from one idea to the next.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Proofread the essay</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, you need to proofread the essay. Look thoroughly for any mistakes and typos! Check for any grammatical or spelling errors in your paper and revise it accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow these essay writing steps correctly to get a clear and perfect essay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to learn more about <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/essay-writing-one-guide-to-master-them-all/\">essay writing</a>?

It usually consists of four to five paragraphs, and each paragraph has its topic sentence. You should give a topic sentence in each paragraph that supports your main argument and thesis statement in each paragraph.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The conclusion is the last part of your essay. It wraps up your essay and presents the reader with the answer to the case. In the first section, you should remind the reader about your thesis statement. Do not add any new information in the conclusion! If you need to add a new point, just create a new paragraph in the body.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deep dive about essay writing structure [<a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/simple-essay-writing-structure-for-everything/\">here</a>].<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you know the steps and structure, but you still do not know what to write and what topic is suited to which type of essay.

(9636, 'simple-essay-writing-structure-for-everything', 3, 0, 'Simple Essay Writing Structure for Everything', '<p>If you are here, then you are still confused about how to outline your essay correctly. Well, <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/essay-writing-one-guide-to-master-them-all/\">essay writing</a> structure is pretty simple, and it applies to every type of essay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we all know, essay types vary from narrative essays, persuasive essays, argumentative essays, expository essays, and descriptive essays. The fact is, at the very core, they all share the same structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The structure of essays is divided into three parts. Those are introductions, body, and conclusion. Pretty simple right? Let\'s dive deep into these three parts based on the types.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Narrative Essay Writing Structure</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The structure of the narrative essay is very particular. You can try to divide it into three parts:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Introduction</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In a Narrative essay, this part will give the readers insight into your story. This part is filled with hooks that entice readers\' curiosity to read more about the story you tell.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Body</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The body structure of the narrative essay is the soul of the story. This is where the readers enjoy reading the most. The body of the narrative essay is divided into three parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Rising Action</li><li>Climax</li><li>Falling Action</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the last part of the narrative essay. This is the part where readers learn the moral of the story.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Argumentative, Descriptive, Expository, and Persuasive Essay</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The structure of the argumentative, descriptive, expository, and persuasive essay is similar to each other. Therefore, You can try to divide it into three parts: </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Introduction</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The introduction part of the essay is the most critical. When writing an introduction, you can divide it into three sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Section one is the part where you present the reader with a hook. A hook is a neutral sentence that engages your reader and arouses their curiosity about your essay.</li><li>Section two is where you present the reader with your topic, background, and thesis statement. By giving background to your topic, you will give the reader more knowledge about your subject. Your thesis statement will represent your answer to the problem.</li><li>Section three is the outline of your whole argument in general. Give a concise explanation of how you plan to address each issue and the order in which you will do it.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Body</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The body paragraph is the essence of your essay. It is usually four to five paragraphs long, each explaining its key point. To keep it simple. Let\'s divide it into three sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The topic sentence comes first. It carries the point of the paragraph. Topic sentence informs the reader about the paragraph\'s topic and the key point it will make.&nbsp;</li><li>The supporting sentences follow, expanding on the main idea by discussing it in greater depth, analyzing what it means, and, of course, providing the evidence and argument that support it. This is where you support your claim with evidence from your study.</li><li>The final part of the paragraph is to remind the reader of your main idea, which restates the notion from the topic sentence.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The conclusion is the last part of an essay. In this part, you summarize your thesis statement and its supporting idea. It does not contain any new information. Remind the readers of the thesis statement first. Do not use the exact words you used in your introduction. Instead, you use different words to emphasize the same point: your overall response to the question is based on your logic. Then give a brief explanation of why your overall conclusions are significant.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember! In this part, the readers should feel as they are learning something new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know more about essay structure?

Pasalnya, ada banyak sekali kebutuhanmu di sana sebagai pelajar internasional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Berikut adalah lampiran biaya untuk biaya akomodasi dan biaya kuliah di Amerika Serikat:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Biaya Akomodasi</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Biaya akomodasi merupakan biaya yang paling penting untuk siswa internasional. Rata-rata apartemen di Amerika Serikat mempunyai harga sewa mulai dari $500 (apartemen satu kamar tidur) hingga $ 1.500 (apartemen 3 kamar tidur di daerah perkotaan).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harga ini juga dapat bervariasi tergantung pada utilitas yang termasuk dalam sewa Anda.

Untuk pelajar asing, lowongan pekerja paruh waktu maksimal 20 jam per minggu. Biasanya kamu akan dibayar per jam dibandingkan per bulan. Kamu bisa bekerja di cafe, restoran cepat saji, sebagai pengantar makanan, pengantar koran, pengasuh anak, atau bekerja di perusahaan agensi kecil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sumber: <a href=\"https://studying-in-us.org/cost-of-living-in-the-united-states/\">https://studying-in-us.org/cost-of-living-in-the-united-states/</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Biaya Kuliah</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Untuk biaya kuliah di Amerika Serikat bervariasi untuk setiap perguruan tinggi.

Mungkin banyak pelajar yang tidak tau, tapi cara kuliah di Amerika itu tidak sesulit yang kita bayangkan lho.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salah satu alasan kenapa banyak orang yang mau berkuliah di Amerika adalah karena kualitas pendidikan Amerika yang sangat tinggi.Selain itu, kurikulum yang unik, lingkungan multikultural, dan banyak peluang adalah beberapa alasan mengapa banyak siswa internasional memilih untuk belajar di negara tersebut. Lebih hebatnya lagi, Universitas di Amerika dikenal luas di kancah dunia karena kualitas pengajaran dan penelitiannya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cara kuliah di Amerika ternyata cukup mudah lho. Berikut adalah langkah-langkah yang bisa kamu lakukan agar bisa berkuliah di Amerika.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Cari Tahu Tentang Universitas</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hal pertama yang harus kamu lakukan adalah melakukan riset tentang universitas yang ingin kamu tuju. Seperti yang kita tahu, Amerika punya banyak universitas dengan kualitas pendidikan yang luar biasa. Kamu harus pintar memilih universitas mana yang mempunyai jurusan yang sesuai dengan minat dan kemampuanmu. Lalu, kamu juga harus mencari tau biaya yang diperlukan untuk akomodasi dan kuliah di tempat tersebut.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mungkin kamu pernah mendengar tentan Ivy League. Ivy League adalah julukan untuk kumpulan universitas unggul di Amerika seperti adalah <em>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</em>, <em>Stanford University</em>, <em>Harvard University</em>, dan <em>California Institute of Technology (Caltech)</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Daftar dan Ikuti Tes Penerimaan</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dari sekian banyak cara <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/id/kuliah-di-amerika-bukan-cuman-sekedar-mimpi/\">kuliah di Amerika</a>, kamu harus memperhatikan hal-hal di bawah ini dengan seksama. Setelah melakukan riset, hal yang bisa kamu lakukan selanjutnya adalah mendaftar dan mengikuti tes penerimaan. Secara umum, berikut adalah persyaratan umum untuk masuk universitas di Amerika:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. <strong>Resume</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Salah satu poin terpenting sebagai syarat pendaftaran universitas di Amerika adalah Resume. Kamu harus sudah menyusun resume sejak dini. Resume ini bisa berisi berbagai macam penghargaan yang telah kamu dapatkan dan pengalaman kegiatan sukarela mu selama bersekolah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. <strong>SAT atau ACT</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>SAT/ACT adalah ujian masuk yang digunakan oleh sebagian besar perguruan tinggi dan universitas untuk membuat keputusan penerimaan. Tujuan SAT/ACT adalah untuk mengukur kesiapan siswa sekolah menengah untuk kuliah, dan menyediakan satu titik data umum yang dapat digunakan untuk membandingkan semua pelamar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. IELTS or TOEFL</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Untuk kuliah di Amerika, kamu wajib untuk mengikuti tes IELTS atau TOEFL. Tujuan dari adanya tes ini adalah untuk menguji seberapa baik tingkat pengetahuan Bahasa Inggrismu. Tentu saja hal ini karena kegiatan akademik dan sosialmu nanti akan menggunakan bahasa inggris. Kamu bisa mendapatkan nilai IELTS atau TOEFL ini dari beberapa lembaga yang menyediakan jasa tersebut. Sudah banyak lembaga di Indonesia yang menyediakan tes IELTS atau TOEFL. Namun beberapa universitas tidak memberlakukan hal ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. <strong><em>Admission Essay</em></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Admission Essay</em> adalah bagian dari proses penerimaan yang bertujuan untuk menyampaikan rasa karakter unik kamu kepada panitia penerimaan. Esai ini menunjukkan keterampilan menulis dan kemampuan mengungkapkan ide dan pikiran secara runtut. Penulisan esai penerimaan sangat penting untuk menunjukan kecocokan kamu dengan universitas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. <strong>Surat Rekomendasi</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Surat Rekomendasi Perguruan Tinggi adalah surat dukungan agar kamu diterima di universitas yang kamu tuju. Isi dari surat ini adalah pernyataan formal singkat yang harus menonjolkan kualitas positif dan menjelaskan mengapa kamu akan berhasil dalam studi perguruan tinggi. Surat rekomendasi yang baik biasanya ditulis oleh guru atau atasan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Susun Anggaran Kuliah</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sayangnya,<a href=\"https://blog.cakap.com/lanjut-kuliah-di-as-atau-inggris-ya-ketahui-dulu-perbedaannya/\"> </a><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/id/kuliah-di-amerika-bukan-cuman-sekedar-mimpi/\">kuliah di Amerika</a> bisa memakan banyak biaya.

You might feel overwhelmed by all the options, but there is no need to worry anymore! We will tell you why studying in Australia should be your option for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might wonder why you should <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/dreaming-to-study-in-australia-read-this-first/\">study in Australia</a>. Australia\'s education system has so many aspects that can help you achieve your potential. Not only that, but living in another country will also give you a chance to rediscover yourself!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be more precise, here are the reasons why you should study in Australia:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. <strong>Top Quality Education</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>People already know that Australia has many great universities. According to the QS University Ranking, five universities in Australia are in the top 50 universities globally. In addition, Australia has a high standard of education through a carefully regulated system that has a vision of nurturing students and producing industry-ready graduates.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from that, we can see the quality of the education from the alumnae. Take a look at dr. Elisabeth Balckburn, who is a Melbourne University graduate and won a Nobel Prize for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. <strong>Career-focused Programs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Australia\'s educational institutions provide a variety of short-term and degree programs that provide essential information in many disciplines and equip students with the required skills to prepare them for the professional world.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students at top-quality universities such as the University of Queensland have the opportunity to transition from one subject to another, allowing them to make an informed decision after exploring. Besides, Australia has become one of the most sought-after destinations for higher education because of its diversified curriculum, student-friendly campuses, and a vast selection of extracurricular activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. <strong>Quality of Life</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This will give you a picture of why studying in Australia is actually good for students. Moreover, according to <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/quality-of-life-rankings\">research</a> by BAV Group and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Australia is ranked sixth globally for its quality of life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Australia has a well-developed public education system and public health system, and it is considered one of the safest countries in the world. You do not need to worry about your well-being when studying in Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>4. <strong>Moderate Living Cost</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to other nations such as the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Canada, Australia\'s tuition prices and living costs are relatively modest. This is also another reason why studying in Australia should be your first choice. Furthermore, academic institutions across the country provide a variety of scholarship programs to help worthy students pay for their education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost of living will vary depending on your lifestyle and personal needs. Your budget should be adaptable enough to deal with unforeseen expenses (e.g., emergencies or health expenses).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'ll need to budget everyday living expenses like housing, meals, and entertainment, as well as set-up and establishment costs, in addition to university fees and textbooks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember to allow enough money for:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Communication</li><li>Transport to and from your place</li><li>Gas</li><li>Electricity</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. <strong>Internship Availability</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a fact that fresh graduates struggle to find a job nowadays. So, an internship is the best way for transitioning from a student into a professional. Also, some universities in Australia offer work opportunities and internships for their students. However, you still need to be actively seeking work opportunities outside the university.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With these benefits, you can be sure to have an advantage in the professional world!

But of course, with the proper budget planning, you\'ll be able to get your finances under control. Furthermore, before setting your foot on Australian soil, let\'s have a look at the cost of studying in Australia!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tuition fee&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In Australian universities, tuition fee greatly depends on what you\'re studying. In addition, this is because different fields require specialized facilities; for instance, engineering students will need workshops, whereas students pursuing medical degrees will require hospital facilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, if you\'re planning to take medical or engineering programs, make sure to plan for a larger budget as it will cost significantly more than other degrees. Besides, the annual tuition fees at Australian universities range from $20,000 AUD to $50,000 AUD.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Accommodation costs in Australia&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While studying in Australia, you\'ll be greeted with a wide range of accommodation options. Moreover, apart from living in on-campus accommodation offered by universities, you can also choose off-campus housing, such as staying with an Australian family or sharing a flat with your friends. Also, Keep in mind that the cost of living varies from city to city. However, you can find the average rate of accommodation in Australia in the following table:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Type of Accomodation&nbsp;</strong></td><td><strong>Average rate&nbsp;</strong></td></tr><tr><td>On-campus Accommodation&nbsp;</td><td>$100 - $500 weekly</td></tr><tr><td>Rented Flat	</td><td>$170 - $450 weekly</td></tr><tr><td>Homestay&nbsp;</td><td>$130 - $280 weekly</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Living expenses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from tuition and accommodation costs, you should set aside enough money for your basic amenities. From grocery shopping, phone bills to emergencies, make sure to keep track of your budget to avoid any overspending.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Living expenses</strong></td><td><strong>Average rate&nbsp;</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Groceries&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>$90 - $250 weekly</td></tr><tr><td>Phone and Mobile Data 	</td><td>$12 to $30 weekly</td></tr><tr><td>Gas and Electricity	</td><td>$15 to $25 weekly</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, see if there are any student discounts available, especially for phone plans, so you can keep in touch with your loved ones without breaking the bank.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Transportation costs&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, universities will provide shuttle services if you live on-campus. Aside from that, you\'ll have to depend on public transportation to move about campus, public attractions, and supermarkets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To navigate around the cities in Australia, you can use trams, buses, trains, and even ferries. In addition, a bus ride over a short distance could cost you $3 AUD. On the other hand, you can purchase a weekly or monthly public transportation pass between $20 AUD and $80 AUD.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Another cost of studying in Australia you should remember: Course Materials&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying textbooks and course materials can be costly, charging somewhere between $300 AUD to $1,000 AUD per year. On the flip side, these are typically one-time expenses, and you can cut down on your cost of studying in Australia by buying second-hand books, purchasing digital versions, or getting a library membership.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have a rough idea about the cost of studying in Australia, would you consider the country as your study destination?

Kuliah di luar negeri membutuhkan beberapa dokumen penting yang wajib untuk kamu sediakan saat mendaftar di universitas. Syarat kuliah di Inggris tidak begitu banyak dan merepotkan lho kalau kamu sudah tahu apa saja yang dibutuhkan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salah satu alasan kenapa syarat kuliah di Inggris banyak adalah karena mutu pendidikan mereka yang masuk dalam kualitas dunia. Selain itu, Inggris juga berperan sebagai kota yang menjadi pusat ekonomi dunia. Maka dari itu, banyak juga perusahaan yang melirik lulusan dari universitas di Inggris.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tidak sembarang orang bisa diterima masuk ke universitas yang ada di sana. Berbeda dari Indonesia, nilai bagus saja tidak menjamin kamu bisa masuk ke sana.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simak beberapa persyaratan yang perlu kamu penuhi untuk bisa kuliah di Inggris:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. <strong>Resume</strong>, Salah Satu Syarat Kuliah di Inggris</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Syarat kuliah di Inggris yang satu ini adalah yang paling awal dan termasuk yang paling penting. Persyaratan tersebut adalah Resume. Kamu harus sudah menyusun resume sejak dini. Resume ini bisa berisi berbagai macam penghargaan yang telah kamu dapatkan dan pengalaman kegiatan sukarela mu selama bersekolah. Agar resume milikmu menarik, kamu bisa mulai aktif kegiatan sukarela dan memulai proyek-proyek pribadi sejak dini.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. <strong>IELTS atau TOEFL</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Untuk kuliah di Inggris, kamu juga wajib untuk mengikuti tes IELTS atau TOEFL. Tujuan diadakannya tes ini adalah untuk menguji seberapa baik tingkat pengetahuan bahasa inggrismu. Sebagai pelajar yang melanjutkan studi di Inggris, tentu saja kamu akan melakukan proses pembelajaran dalam bahasa Inggris. Kamu bisa mendapatkan nilai IELTS atau TOEFL ini dari beberapa lembaga yang menyediakan jasa tersebut. Sudah banyak lembaga di Indonesia yang menyediakan tes IELTS atau TOEFL. Namun beberapa universitas tidak memberlakukan hal ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. <strong>Transkrip Nilai</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Transkrip Nilai adalah kumpulan semua nilai kamu selama kamu bersekolah. Dokumen ini mencakup nilai secara keseluruhan dari semester 1 sampai kamu lulus. Tujuan diperlukannya dokumen ini adalah supaya staf universitas tersebut dapat mengetahui secara garis besar tentang performa akademikmu selama bersekolah. Jadi, pastikan kamu untuk rajin belajar sejak awal ya!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. <strong>SAT atau ACT</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SAT/ACT adalah ujian masuk yang digunakan oleh sebagian besar perguruan tinggi dan universitas untuk membuat keputusan penerimaan. Tujuan SAT/ACT adalah untuk mengukur kesiapan siswa sekolah menengah untuk kuliah, dan menyediakan satu titik data umum yang dapat digunakan untuk membandingkan semua pelamar. Tapi tidak semua universitas di Inggris mengharuskan kamu untuk mengikuti tes SAT atau ACT. Jadi, kamu harus memperhatikan persyaratan apa saja yang kamu butuhkan untuk melanjutkan studimu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. <strong>Surat Rekomendasi</strong>, Salah Satu Syarat Kuliah di Inggris</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Surat Rekomendasi Perguruan Tinggi adalah surat dukungan agar kamu diterima di universitas yang kamu tuju. Dokumen ini berisi pernyataan formal singkat yang harus menonjolkan kualitas positif dan menjelaskan mengapa kamu akan berhasil dalam studi perguruan tinggi. Surat rekomendasi yang baik biasanya ditulis oleh guru atau atasan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. <strong><em>Personal Statement</em></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Personal Statement adalah sebuah esai yang menunjukan ke pihak penerimaan universitas di Inggris bahwa kamu adalah kandidat yang cocok untuk diterima di universitas tersebut.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7. <strong>Interview</strong>, Salah Satu Syarat Kuliah di Inggris</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Syarat kuliah di Inggris yang terakhir adalah interview dengan staf penerimaan. Interview bertujuan agar staf penerimaan bisa mengenal dan menilai kamu secara langsung.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syarat kuliah di Inggris ini memang sangat banyak.

Throughout the application process, you\'ll commonly be required to get a letter of recommendation for university. What is it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lucky for you, we\'ll find out what a letter of recommendation for university is, as well as a few tips to boost your chance of getting a strong letter of recommendation!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is a Letter of Recommendation for University?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A letter of recommendation is a letter written by your high school teacher, or in some cases, guidance counselors, to describe you, your potential, as well as your personality. This gives admission officers a chance to know you holistically.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some activities, grades, and hobbies may be common among applications, letters of recommendation make you stand out by highlighting your key characteristics as well as what you offer to the table that no one else can.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tips When Asking for a Letter of Recommendation for University</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Give Your Referee Enough Time </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that teachers may be flooded with requests to write letters of recommendation, especially during the university application season. Therefore, it\'s best to ask them as early as possible, so they have enough time and attention to work on an accurate letter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Provide Helpful Information to Your Referee</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of handing out the format of the letter, deadlines, as well as the submission address to your referee, you can also include a brag sheet. It\'s a list that highlights your accomplishments and characteristics. Include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Copies of personal statements or admission essays&nbsp;</li><li>Community work or extracurricular activities&nbsp;</li><li>Academic transcripts, test scores, and academic accomplishments</li><li>A brief description of your goals and aspirations for the program you\'re applying for&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Select The Best-suited Person to Write The Letter of Recommendation for University</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\'re applying to an economics program, a business or economics teacher might be a better fit to be your referee. After all, the purpose of a letter of recommendation is for the admissions committee to understand better who you are and your skills. Hence it would be great to ask someone who knows you and your abilities well. In addition, you can ask teachers who have taught you recently. Preferably within the past two years, as their memories of you and your character are still fresh.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Set Up a Time to Communicate Your Desires </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of being passive and relying solely on their thoughts for your letter of recommendation. Try to discuss your academic interests, goals for the university, or even career aspirations with your referee. Not only can this help them to understand yourself more, but it also allows them to highlight your most relevant skills and ambitions in your letter of recommendation for university.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Express Your Gratitude</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\'t forget to write your referee a thank you note. This is including updates about your application to show your appreciation for their support.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might feel nervous, especially if this is your first time asking for a letter of recommendation for university. Nevertheless, once you have figured out the process, you\'ll be on your way to getting a strong letter of recommendation!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Planning to save yourself a seat in your dream university?

Read on to check out what is a letter of recommendation for a scholarship, including who you can ask to write them, and some helpful tips!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is a Letter of Recommendation for Scholarship?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A letter of recommendation is a document that provides insights into yourself as a student and as a person from the perspective of a referee who knows you well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be strategic in deciding who to ask to be your referee. Your referee should demonstrate why you\'re a suitable fit for the scholarship. They should already know you for at least a year and stayed in touch with you recently. They should have regular contact with you so that they can speak well about your academic strengths, characters, and role in the community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this way, the scholarship committee can obtain an objective perspective or a second opinion on who you are. This allows them to gain a comprehensive understanding of you and verify your character or performance with the information you\'ve presented in other documents, including your motivation letter and CV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who should you ask to write your letter of recommendation for scholarship?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although each scholarship has different requirements for the referee of a recommendation letter, scholarship committees typically don\'t look at recommendation letters from personal relationships. Therefore, a family member, a partner, or a friend cannot be a referee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, try to match your referee with the type of scholarship you\'re applying for. For instance, if you\'re applying for a scholarship in the STEM field, you can pick your science or math teacher to be your referee. Choose someone who understands you well to get a strong letter of recommendation!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tips on Getting a Strong Letter</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ask early </strong>- Chances are, your referee will have several different responsibilities. Therefore, it is highly recommended to contact them about three or four weeks before the deadline so that they have enough time to write a compelling letter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Provide valuable details</strong> - Be sure to give your referee enough details, including who to send the letter to, the deadline, as well as the instructions. You can also send a copy of your CV and academic transcript, which might help them get a better picture of your skills and performance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Remind, remind, and remind</strong> - When the time to apply has arrived and you don\'t have your letter of recommendation for scholarship, you may lose the chance to land the scholarship of your dreams. Therefore, remind your referee to submit their letter a few days before the deadline. Mark the date on your calendar, if possible!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aiming to get your dream scholarship?

Sebenarnya caranya tidak sesulit yang kamu bayangkan kok. Ayo simak proses pendaftaran universitas di Australia!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Australia adalah salah satu negara yang menjadi tujuan utama untuk siswa internasional. Selain karena kualitas pendidikannya yang tinggi, lingkungan multikulturalnya menjadi daya tarik tersendiri untuk melanjutkan pendidikan di sana. Lalu, <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/id/mau-masuk-universitas-di-australia-ketahui-hal-ini/\">universitas di Australia</a> juga berhasil menghasilkan lulusan-lulusan hebat. Salah satunya adalah Elizabeth Blackburn yang meraih penghargaan <em>Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</em> pada tahun 2009.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Untuk bisa masuk dan diterima di universitas di Australia, ada beberapa persyaratan dan dokumen penting yang patut untuk kamu persiapkan lho. Hanya sekedar nilai yang bagus tidak cukup untuk membuatmu diterima dalam pendaftaran universitas di Australia. Kamu harus mempersiapkannya dengan benar-benar matang.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ada beberapa hal penting yang harus kamu perhatikan dalam proses pendaftaran universitas di Australia, seperti:<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>SAT atau ACT</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SAT/ACT adalah ujian masuk yang digunakan oleh sebagian besar perguruan tinggi dan universitas untuk membuat keputusan penerimaan. Tujuan SAT/ACT adalah untuk mengukur kesiapan siswa sekolah menengah untuk kuliah, dan menyediakan satu titik data umum yang dapat digunakan untuk membandingkan semua pelamar. Ada satu hal yang perlu kamu ingat. Di Australia, tidak semua universitas mewajibkan kamu untuk mengambil tes ini, jadi <em>make sure </em>kamu sudah melihat syarat pendaftaran universitas sebelum mengambil tes ini ya!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Transkrip Nilai</strong> untuk Pendaftaran Universitas di Australia </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Transkrip Nilai adalah kumpulan semua nilai kamu selama kamu bersekolah. Dokumen ini mencakup nilai secara keseluruhan dari semester 1 sampai kamu lulus. Kamu bisa meminta dokumen ini ke pihak sekolahmu. Tujuan diperlukannya dokumen ini adalah supaya staf universitas tersebut dapat mengetahui secara garis besar tentang performa akademikmu selama bersekolah. Jadi, pastikan kamu untuk rajin belajar sejak awal ya!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>IELTS atau TOEFL</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Untuk kuliah di Australia, kamu wajib untuk mengikuti tes IELTS atau TOEFL. Tujuan dari adanya tes ini adalah untuk menguji seberapa baik tingkat pengetahuan bahasa inggrismu. Tentu saja hal ini karena kegiatan akademik dan sosialmu nanti akan menggunakan Bahasa Inggris. Kamu bisa mendapatkan nilai IELTS atau TOEFL ini dari beberapa lembaga yang menyediakan jasa tersebut. Sudah banyak lembaga di Indonesia yang menyediakan tes IELTS atau TOEFL. Namun beberapa universitas tidak memberlakukan hal ini. Di Australia, hal ini hanya diperlukan di jurusan yang menggunakan bahasa inggris sebagai bahasa pengajaran.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><em>Essay</em></strong> untuk Pendaftaran Universitas di Australia</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Essay</em> adalah bagian dari proses penerimaan yang bertujuan untuk menyampaikan rasa karakter unik kamu kepada panitia penerimaan. Beberapa universitas di Australia mengharuskan kamu untuk membuat esai ini. Hal ini dimaksudkan agar kamu menunjukkan keterampilan menulis dan kemampuan mengungkapkan ide dan pikiran secara runtut. Penulisan esai penerimaan sangat penting untuk menunjukan kecocokan kamu dengan universitas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Ajukan Visa Pelajar</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sebagai siswa internasional, kamu harus mengajukan visa untuk bisa tinggal dan belajar di sana. Visa yang kamu ajukan ini masuk di kriteria <em>Genuine Temporary Entrant</em> (GTE). GTE adalah protokol untuk memastikan bahwa tujuan kamu di Australia adalah untuk belajar dan bukan untuk menetap di sana.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kamu harus selalu memastikan bahwa persayratan universitas di Australia di atas sudah kamu siapkan. Selain itu, kamu bisa mulai mencicil persayaratan tersebut selagi kamu masih bersekolah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Setelah semua proses ini telah kamu lalui, kamu hanya tinggal berangkat ke Australia.

(9961, 'public-universities-in-the-usa-know-the-ins-and-outs', 1, 0, 'Public Universities in The USA: Know the Ins and Outs', '<p>At first glance, you may be confused about which universities in the USA are actually public universities. Lucky for you, we\'re here to help you learn more about public universities in the USA!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is a Public University?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast to private universities, public universities are funded primarily by the state government through tax revenues and subsidies. These institutions, which range in size from small liberal art colleges to large research institutions, can be found in each state in the USA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let\'s deep dive into the features of public universities in the USA!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Bigger in size</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, public universities are larger as there are more students enrolled. This is partly due to in-state tuition, which allows locals to pay lower tuition than students from other states or countries. In some cases, public universities are even required to accept a certain number of students from their home states in order to keep their funding. As a result, the admissions process can be more competitive, although they collect a bigger application pool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from having larger campuses, public universities also have larger classes, with some holding hundreds of students. Public universities also offer more facilities to meet their students\' needs, including restaurants, bowling alleys, and movie theaters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Wider selection of extracurricular activities and clubs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to a large number of enrolled students, you can easily find hundreds of student organizations, ranging from general interests to specific ones. On top of that, there will be more social events, campus performances, and extracurricular activities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Lower tuition fees</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the common factors in deciding which university to choose is the tuition costs. When compared to private universities, public universities typically charge lower tuition prices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Public universities have an average tuition fee of $35,000 USD to $47,000 USD per year, while private universities can charge more than $50,000 USD per year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Longer list of programs</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result of their size, public universities tend to offer a wider array of degree programs and faculty. That means if you\'re still unsure of what you want to study, or planning to study a difficult-to-find degree or something specific, attending a public university will suit you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Top public universities in the USA</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be a lot of public universities, but you can choose the best of the best. Furthermore, these are the top-ranked public universities in the Best Colleges rankings for 2022 according to US News:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>UC Los Angeles</li><li>UC Berkeley</li><li>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</li><li>University of Virginia</li><li>UC Santa Barbara</li><li>University of Florida</li><li>University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill</li><li>UC San Diego&nbsp;</li><li>UC Irvine&nbsp;</li><li>Georgia Institute of Technology</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>After knowing the ins and outs of public <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/everything-to-know-about-universities-in-the-usa/\">universities in the USA</a>, are you interested in studying at one of them?

(9966, 'private-universities-in-the-usa-know-the-features', 1, 0, 'Private Universities in The USA: Know The Features', '<p>Chances are, you might have heard of Ivy League universities. Well, are you actually aware that they are private universities? Furthermore, are you familiar with the features of private universities? Save your worries; we\'ll cover everything you need to know about private universities in the USA!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is a Private University?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A private university, which can be in the form of a nonprofit or for-profit organization, is an educational institution that is not funded or run by the state government. Instead, funding comes from students\' tuition fees, private donor endowments, and contributions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stricter Admission Criteria</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Public universities usually admit a large number of applicants and possess flexible eligibility criteria. Additionally, this is not the case in private universities, as they are known to accept a limited number of seats and pose strict eligibility requirements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Ivy League universities have an overall acceptance rate of less than 10% in 2020, which is lower than the average acceptance rate for public universities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Higher Tuition Fees</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to tuition fees, private universities charge higher as their operation is dependent on students\' educational costs. While the cost of attending private universities may sound excessive, they often provide scholarships or financial aid to students who demonstrate financial need.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Princeton University, which is one of the Ivy League universities, offers financial aid to around 61% of their undergraduates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geographically Diverse</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Private universities charge the same tuition rates for all state residents in the USA, which attracts students from all over the country. As a result, the student population is often more diverse in terms of US geography. That means if you plan on attending a private university in Minnesota, for instance, you\'ll have a better chance of meeting students from other states besides Minnesota!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>More Specific Program Offerings</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of private universities, they would generally offer fewer academic majors than public universities. This can be a good thing, especially if you know what you want to study, as you can benefit from specialized programs offered in private universities.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Smaller Class Sizes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some students thrive in larger classes, while others feel overwhelmed. If you fall in the latter category, studying in private universities may be a better fit for you. This is because private universities tend to have relatively small class sizes, which allow students to have one-on-one interaction with professors and actively engage in the classroom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Top Private Universities in The USA</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the top 7 private universities in the USA, according to the Times Higher Education\'s US College Rankings:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Harvard University&nbsp;</li><li>Stanford University&nbsp;</li><li>Massachusetts Institute of Technology&nbsp;</li><li>Yale University&nbsp;</li><li>Duke University</li><li>Brown University</li><li>California Institute of Technology&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you figured out which private university you\'ll attend?

So, make sure you study hard from the start!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. <strong>SAT or ACT</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The SAT/ACT is the entrance exam used by most colleges and universities to make admissions decisions. Therefore, the purpose of the SAT/ACT is to measure a high school student\'s academic readiness for college and to provide a common data point with which to compare all applicants. Although it is not required, you are suggested to take the SAT to differ yourself from other applicants.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>5. Recommendation Letter</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to know about how to apply to the universities in the USA, you need to know about this requirement too. Additionally, a college recommendation letter is a letter of support for your acceptance at the university you are aiming for. This letter of recommendation contains a brief formal statement that should highlight your positive qualities and explain why you will be successful in your college studies. A good recommendation letter is usually written by a teacher or supervisor that knows you well. In addition, you need to have 2 - 3 letters of recommendation to maximize your chance to get into university in the USA.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. <strong>Essay</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the application process, most USA universities require applicants to write several short essays on themselves or a specified topic. These essays allow you to express yourself clearly and give admissions examiners a clearer sense of how well you would fit in at the institution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7. <strong>Interview</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The last requirement to study in the USA is an interview with the admissions staff.

Let\'s find out more about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Public Universities in the USA</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, you may be confused about which universities in the USA are actually public universities. Lucky for you, we\'re here to help you learn more about public universities in the USA!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What is a Public University?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast to private universities, public universities are funded primarily by state governments through tax revenues and subsidies. These institutions, which range in size from small liberal art colleges to large research institutions, can be found in each state in the USA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let\'s deep dive into the features of public universities in the USA!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bigger in size</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, public universities are larger as there are more students enrolled. This is partly due to in-state tuition, which allows locals to pay lower tuition than students from other states or countries. As a result, the admissions process can be more competitive, although they collect a bigger application pool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from having larger campuses, public universities also have larger classes, with some holding hundreds of students. Public universities also offer more facilities to meet their students\' needs, including restaurants, bowling alleys, and movie theatres.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>A Wider Selection of Extracurricular Activities and Clubs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to a large number of enrolled students, you can easily find hundreds of student organizations, ranging from general interests to specific ones. On top of that, there will be more social events, campus performances, and extracurricular activities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\"><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/public-universities-in-the-usa-know-the-ins-and-outs/\">Read here to know more about public universities in the USA</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Private Universities in The USA</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Chances are, you might have heard of Ivy League universities. Well, are you actually aware that they are private universities? Are you familiar with the features of private universities? Save your worries; we\'ll cover everything you need to know about private universities in the USA!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What is a Private University?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A private university, which can be in the form of a nonprofit or for-profit organization, is an educational institution that is not funded or run by the state government. Instead, funding comes from students\' tuition fees, private donor endowments, and contributions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on to find out the features of <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/private-universities-in-the-usa-know-the-features/\">private universities in the USA</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Stricter Admission Criteria</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Public universities usually admit a large number of applicants and possess flexible eligibility criteria. But this is not the case in private universities, as they are known to accept a limited number of seats and pose strict eligibility requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Higher Tuition Fees</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to tuition fees, private universities charge higher as their operation is dependent on students\' educational costs. While the cost of attending private universities may sound excessive, they often provide scholarships or financial aid to students who demonstrate financial need.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Geographically Diverse</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Private universities charge the same tuition rates for all state residents in the USA, which attracts students from all over the country. As a result, the student population is often more diverse in terms of US geography. That means if you plan on attending a private university in Minnesota, for instance, you\'ll have a better chance of meeting students from other states besides Minnesota!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\"><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/private-universities-in-the-usa-know-the-features/\">Still curious?

Which one should you choose, a subject that you like or a subject that you need? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We recommend you to set your career goal and choose your preferred major or university, and also discuss this with your school counselor or mentors here at ALL-in!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Tips & Tricks from Chiara, ALL-in Mentor.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey! It\'s Chiara, one of the mentors at ALL-in. I\'m here to give you a few tips about choosing the right subjects for your DP. I took IB in high school too, so I know very well the amount of pressure you might be under. It can be stressful having to choose your subjects before you even know what you want to major in for university, but I hope these tips will help.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cover your bases</strong>. If you\'re not sure what major you want to do yet, that\'s fine! But try to choose one or two faculties you might be interested in and see what subjects and HLs they require. These will be the first subjects that you need to take.</li><li><strong>Balance your interest with capacity. </strong>If you\'ve already chosen two difficult, required HLs and are considering another one for your own interest, look at the subject syllabus and skim through some of the content. Do you think you might be able to handle it as an HL, considering your other subjects? You want to make sure that you\'re not spending all your time in DP studying; you want to have time to build your profile and of course, have fun!</li><li><strong>Consider your destination! </strong>Different countries have vastly different requirements and focus for university application. If you\'re going to the US, where your profile and CV are extremely important, make sure you have time to work on your personal projects and build your profile. On the other hand, if you\'re planning on going to Australia, where your grades are the most important factor and there isn\'t usually a required IB subject as a prerequisite, focus on choosing subjects that you\'re best at and will help you achieve a high IB score.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s really it. I know each one of you will be considering different things, but at the end of the day, you want a balance of subjects you like and subjects you\'re good at.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need more help navigating the IB DP?

(10073, 'syarat-kuliah-di-jepang-yang-kamu-harus-tahu', 2, 0, 'Syarat Kuliah di Jepang Yang Kamu Harus Tahu!', '<p>Jepang merupakan salah satu negara dengan kualitas pendidikan terbaik di Asia. Untuk bisa masuk ke universitas di negara ini, kamu harus melewati beberapa proses khusus yang berbeda dari negara lain. Kamu harus mempersiapkan dan mengikuti beberapa syarat kuliah di Jepang.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Selain karena kualitas pendidikan yang luar biasa, beberapa pelajar internasional sudah terpikat terlebih dahulu dengan budaya yang ada di sana. Budaya populer Jepang terdiri dari berbagai macam jenis produk budaya, contohnya anime, manga (komik), Japan music (J-pop), dorama, dan gim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karena daya saing yang tinggi, kamu harus mempersiapkan persiapan dengan matang. Banyak pelajar internasional yang gagal karena mereka meremehkan persiapan masuk universitas di Jepang. Berikut adalah beberapa syarat kuliah di Jepang yang perlu kamu persiapkan:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Syarat kuliah di Jepang: <strong>Resume</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Syarat ini merupakan yang paling awal dan termasuk yang paling penting. Persyaratan tersebut adalah Resume. Kamu harus sudah menyusun resume sejak dini. Resume ini bisa berisi berbagai macam penghargaan yang telah kamu dapatkan dan pengalaman kegiatan sukarela mu selama bersekolah. Agar resume milikmu menarik, kamu bisa mulai aktif kegiatan sukarela dan memulai proyek-proyek pribadi sejak dini.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Ujian Kemampuan Berbahasa Jepang (JLPT)</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Syarat kuliah di Jepang yang satu ini merupakan yang paling wajib untuk kamu ambil. Seperti yang kita tahu, ketika kamu kuliah di Jepang, kamu akan belajar dan berkomunikasi sehari-hari menggunakan bahasa jepang. Ujian ini dirancang untuk mengukur kemampuan bahasa Jepang dari pelajar yang tidak menggunakan bahasa Jepang sebagai bahasa utamanya. JLPT (<em>Japanese Language Proficiency Test</em>) ditawarkan dua kali per tahun pada bulan Juli dan Desember dan dikelola oleh <em>Japan Educational Exchanges and Services</em> (JEES) dan <em>Japan Foundation</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ada lima level - N1, N2, N3, N4 dan N5 - dengan N5 yang paling mudah dan N1 yang paling sulit. N1 dan N2 berguna sebagai bukti kemampuan bahasa Jepang saat mencari pekerjaan di Jepang atau melakukan kegiatan serupa. Siswa internasional didorong untuk mengikuti tes ini, baik untuk mengukur kemampuan bahasa Jepang mereka sendiri atau untuk membantu mereka mencari pekerjaan di masa depan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Ujian Masuk</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>EJU (<em>Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students</em>) adalah ujian yang dirancang untuk pelajar internasional yang ingin mendaftar dan belajar di universitas Jepang (sarjana), dll. Ujian masuk ini menguji pengetahuan akademik dasar (Sains, Jepang dan Dunia, dan Matematika). Tidak ada batasan berapa umur atau kesempatan untuk kamu yang ingin mengikuti EJU. Skor EJU berlaku selama dua tahun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>485 universitas, atau 60% universitas Jepang, termasuk sebagian besar universitas nasional memerlukan penyerahan skor EJU sebagai bagian dari aplikasi. Manfaat lain dari EJU adalah bahwa beberapa sekolah menawarkan \"penerimaan sebelum kedatangan\" di mana siswa yang mengambil EJU dapat diterima di sekolah sebelum tiba di Jepang, dan ada beasiswa kehormatan bagi siswa yang mencapai nilai tinggi di EJU.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Syarat kuliah di Jepang: <strong><em>Essay</em></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Admission Essay</em> adalah bagian dari proses penerimaan yang bertujuan untuk menyampaikan rasa karakter unik kamu kepada panitia penerimaan. Esai ini menunjukkan keterampilan menulis dan kemampuan mengungkapkan ide dan pikiran secara runtut. Penulisan esai penerimaan sangat penting untuk menunjukan kecocokan kamu dengan universitas. Di Jepang, hanya beberapa universitas yang mengharuskan kamu untuk mengumpulkan essay ini. Jadi, harap memperhatikan persyaratan tiap universitas dengan lebih seksama ya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kamu pasti jadi lebih semangat kan untuk bisa <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/id/kuliah-di-jepang-kamu-wajib-tahu-ini/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"kuliah di Jepang (opens in a new tab)\">kuliah di Jepang</a>?

Kamu harus mempersiapkan banyak hal lho sebelum berangkat ke sana. Salah satu contohnya adalah biaya pengeluaran. Biaya kuliah di Jepang tentunya jauh lebih mahal dibanding dengan biaya kuliah di Indonesia. Pastikan kamu membuat anggaran yang detail ya!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Negeri sakura ini selain terkenal dengan industri animasi dan game, juga terkenal dengan kualitas pendidikan yang luar biasa. Universitas di Jepang merupakan salah satu yang terbaik di Asia. Maka dari itu, biaya kuliah dan hidup di sana juga menjadi lebih mahal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ayo kita bongkar keseluruhan pengeluaran pelajar internasional yang berkuliah di Jepang.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Biaya Kuliah di Jepang: UKT</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>37 universitas Jepang termasuk dalam bagian dari Top Global University Initiative. Top Global University Initiative adalah campuran antara universitas nasional dan swasta, serta dua universitas prefektur. Di bawah hukum Jepang, universitas nasional memiliki biaya kuliah yang sama, terlepas dari program internasional atau domestik.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biaya kuliah itu sendiri per tahun ditetapkan pada ¥585.800 yen (sekitar Rp. 73.000.000). Ada biaya masuk terpisah di tahun pertama, yang juga ditetapkan pada ¥282.000 yen (sekitar Rp. 36.000.000). Selain biaya kuliah, ada biaya terpisah lainnya seperti biaya fasilitas, biaya peralatan, dan biaya pemeliharaan lainnya yang juga dibayarkan setiap tahun berdasarkan jurusan dan departemen. Oleh karena itu, total biayanya setidaknya ¥817.800 yen (sekitar Rp. 102.000.000). Uang sekolah dibayar per semester dan dibagi rata sehingga setiap pembayaran adalah pembayaran satu kali sebesar ¥267.900 yen. Biasanya, mahasiswa sains dan kedokteran memiliki total biaya kuliah yang lebih tinggi karena biaya peralatan untuk laboratorium dan eksperimen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Biaya Hidup</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Selain biaya kuliah, salah satu biaya yang akan kamu keluarkan adalah biaya hidup. Hal ini tergantung dengan gaya hidup kamu dan seberapa konsumtif kamu selama di sana. Kamu harus mempersiapkannya jauh-jauh hari. Seperti biaya tempat tinggal, makanan, dan hiburan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Berikut adalah lampiran biaya hidup yang mungkin kamu butuhkan di sana:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Akomodasi</strong>: Berbagi tempat tinggal dengan teman menjadi salah satu opsi yang paling populer selama beberapa tahun ini. Pada tahun 2015, sekitar 85% siswa menyewa secara pribadi. Survei menunjukkan bahwa sewa bulanan rata-rata untuk siswa (termasuk biaya layanan) di Tokyo adalah sekitar ¥60.000 ($520)</li><li><strong>Makanan</strong>: Biaya kebutuhan untuk makan sangat bervariasi. Ada banyak restoran dan tempat makan yang menawarkan makan siang dan makan malam seharga ¥800-1000. Paket sarapan di kafe dapat dibeli hanya dengan ¥400. Ini, tentu saja, jika kamu memilih untuk makan di luar. Biaya akan menjadi lebih rendah secara signifikan jika kamu memasak sendiri, dan kantin universitas biasanya menyediakan makanan seperti ramen seharga ¥300-500. Toko serba ada juga merupakan pilihan bagus lainnya, menjual salad segar, sandwich, dan makanan lainnya seharga ¥200-500. Biaya makanan rata-rata per bulan diperkirakan sekitar ¥25.000.</li><li><strong>Komunikasi</strong>: Tidak ada sistem <em>pay-as-you-talk </em>di Jepang, tetapi ada opsi untuk berlangganan telepon bulanan di bawah ¥2.000 (Rp. 250.000).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Biaya hidup yang akan kamu keluarkan tentu saja tergantung pada kota tempat tinggalmu. Sebagai contohnya, jika kamu memutuskan tinggal di Tokyo, biaya hidup yang akan kamu keluarkan tentunya jauh lebih besar dibanding tinggal di kota yang lebih kecil.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Biaya Transportasi</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Japan Rail East (JR East), sejauh ini merupakan operator jaringan kereta api terbesar di Jepang. Perusahaan ini menawarkan diskon 20% kepada pelajar untuk tiket komuter yang juga berlaku di akhir pekan. Untuk perjalanan di dalam 23 Daerah Khusus Tokyo, ini setara dengan biaya tiket kereta komuter 3 bulan yaitu sekitar ¥20.000 (Rp. 2.500.000) untuk pelajar. Tentu saja, semakin dekat kamu dengan universitas, biaya transportasi akan lebih murah, dan biaya rata-rata 1 bulan untuk siswa diperkirakan ¥5,000 (Rp. 630.000).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banyak juga kan pengeluaranmu di Jepang? Kamu juga mendapatkan bantuan dana untuk kuliahmu lho. Jepang juga menyediakan berbagai macam beasiswa yang dapat membantu pelajar internasional di sana.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ayo persiapkan aplikasi masuk universitas di Jepang bersama EDUVERSE by ALL-in!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dapatkan informasi tambahan tentang:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Study Abroad</li><li>Beasiswa</li><li><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/id/programs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Eksplorasi Karir dan Jurusan (opens in a new tab)\">Eksplorasi Karir dan Jurusan</a></li><li>Bedah Universitas</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Yuk follow Instagram kita: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/edu.verse_/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"@edu.verse_ (opens in a new tab)\">@edu.verse_</a> dan join Telegram: <a href=\"http://t.me/Allineduverse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"t.me/Allineduverse (opens in a new tab)\">t.me/Allineduverse</a> untuk diskusi sama expert!<br></p>', 'Sw4T0Ap511BgiKU8pcWpkk7o2fP5KJRw38-34Tl51Syrq3WPlkitm4ufqrfXmXXgNJv7g4otCYHHKmNl6h4SxzCTNb7ARqV0jf1R.jpg', 'Kisaran Biaya Kuliah di Jepang Terbaru!', 'publish', '', 'Biaya Kuliah di Jepang', 'Biaya kuliah di Jepang sangat berbeda dengan di Indonesia.

Pastikan kamu membuat anggaran yang detail ya!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Negeri sakura ini selain terkenal dengan industri animasi dan game, juga terkenal dengan kualitas pendidikan yang luar biasa. Universitas di jepang merupakan salah satu yang terbaik di Asia. Maka dari itu, biaya kuliah dan hidup di sana juga menjadi lebih mahal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ayo kita bongkar keseluruhan pengeluaran pelajar internasional yang berkuliah di Jepang.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Biaya Universitas</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>37 universitas Jepang termasuk dalam bagian dari Top Global University Initiative. Top Global University Initiative adalah campuran antara universitas nasional dan swasta, serta dua universitas prefektur. Biaya kuliah itu sendiri per tahun ditetapkan pada ¥585.800 yen (sekitar Rp. 73.000.000). Ada biaya masuk terpisah di tahun pertama, yang juga ditetapkan pada ¥282.000 yen (sekitar Rp. 36.000.000).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Biaya Hidup</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Selain biaya kuliah, salah satu biaya yang akan kamu keluarkan adalah biaya hidup. Hal ini tergantung dengan gaya hidup kamu dan seberapa konsumtif kamu selama di sana. Survei menunjukkan bahwa sewa bulanan rata-rata untuk siswa (termasuk biaya layanan) di Tokyo adalah sekitar ¥60.000 ($520). Biaya kebutuhan untuk makan sangat bervariasi. Ada banyak restoran dan tempat makan yang menawarkan makan siang dan makan malam seharga ¥800-1000. Paket sarapan di kafe dapat dibeli hanya dengan ¥400. Biaya akan menjadi lebih rendah secara signifikan jika kamu memasak sendiri.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Biaya Transportasi</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Japan Rail East (JR East), sejauh ini merupakan operator jaringan kereta api terbesar di Jepang. Untuk perjalanan di dalam 23 Daerah Khusus Tokyo, ini setara dengan biaya tiket kereta komuter 3 bulan yaitu sekitar ¥20.000 (Rp. 2.500.000) untuk pelajar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\"><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/id/kisaran-biaya-kuliah-di-jepang-terbaru/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Penasaran dengan biaya lainnya?

Students must fulfill the prerequisites for an IB Diploma, which include taking lessons in the six IB subject areas, passing the final IB exams, and completing three additional core requirements. Choosing your IB subjects is a pivotal moment for you as a student because some of these subjects are the prerequisite for some university major.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>So, What are the six IB subject groups?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Students pursuing an International Baccalaureate (IB) credential must select a subject from one of six categories: language and literary studies, language acquisition, individuals and societies, sciences, mathematics, and the arts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students enrolled in the IB must take six subjects from six groups. They also have to choose at least three subjects at the higher level (HL), with the rest of their studies at the standard level (SL).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the subject groups that you need to know:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/curriculum/\">https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/curriculum/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Group 1: Studies in Language and Literature</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first group subject is focused on language and literature.

If so, aside from the required subjects, what other subjects suit your profile? Which one should you choose, a subject that you like or a subject that you need? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We recommend you to set your career goal and choose your preferred major or university, and also discuss this with your school counselor or mentors here at ALL-in!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Tips & Tricks from Chiara, ALL-in Mentor.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey! It\'s Chiara, one of the mentors at ALL-in. I\'m here to give you a few tips about choosing the right subjects for your DP. I took IB in high school too, so I know very well the amount of pressure you might be under. It can be stressful having to choose your subjects before you even know what you want to major in for university, but I hope these tips will help.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cover your bases</strong>. If you\'re not sure what major you want to do yet, that\'s fine! But try to choose one or two faculties you might be interested in and see what subjects and HLs they require. These will be the first subjects that you need to take.</li><li><strong>Balance your interest with capacity. </strong>If you\'ve already chosen two difficult, required HLs and are considering another one for your own interest, look at the subject syllabus and skim through some of the content. Do you think you might be able to handle it as an HL, considering your other subjects? You want to make sure that you\'re not spending all your time in DP studying; you want to have time to build your profile and of course, have fun!</li><li><strong>Consider your destination! </strong>Different countries have vastly different requirements and focus for university application. If you\'re going to the US, where your profile and CV are extremely important, make sure you have time to work on your personal projects and build your profile. On the other hand, if you\'re planning on going to Australia, where your grades are the most important factor and there isn\'t usually a required IB subject as a prerequisite, focus on choosing subjects that you\'re best at and will help you achieve a high IB score.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s really it. I know each one of you will be considering different things, but at the end of the day, you want a balance of subjects you like and subjects you\'re good at.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need more help navigating the IB DP?

At a time when students are competing for spots at the world\'s best universities, a personal brand is one of the most important elements. So, what is personal branding? And how can you convey your best self on paper? Let\'s dive deeper into personal branding strategy to boost your profile!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is personal branding?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In simple words, <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/personal-branding-why-is-it-important-for-students/\">personal branding</a> refers to how you display yourself in the eyes of the public. In the case of a university application, admission officers are your audience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When applying to universities, you\'ll be up against hundreds or thousands of people, some of whom may share your interests. So, what makes you unique in terms of your background, accomplishments, and passion? And how can you make your uniqueness stand out?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>This Is Where Personal Branding Strategy Comes In</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of admission requirements, each university is different. Some may require a personal statement, while others may require essays, recommendation letters, or even videos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all those documents being submitted, admission officers will go over the whole package—including your essays, personal statement, letter of recommendations, CV, high school transcripts—in one sitting to get to know you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is to say before you begin working on your application, you should first develop a personal branding strategy. In your application, you want it to be an accurate reflection of yourself so that the admissions officer feels as if he or she has met you in person.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Start by self-reflection&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-reflection lays a great foundation for a good application. Serving as your ‘pre-writing\' session, it shouldn\'t take a long time. You can simply sit down and brainstorm for five minutes. And then you can start building a brief outline of what you want your brand to be, which might include your experiences, perspectives, or perhaps goals for the future.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Putting all the pieces together</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In all of the documents, including the essays, it shouldn\'t feel as if one doesn\'t fit in with the rest or as if each one was written by a different person. You have to make sure they all make sense and don\'t contradict one another. Before accepting you into their university, admission officers want to get to know yourself holistically. They won\'t get a clear picture of who you are or what you would offer if everything seems to be all over the place. But of course, ensure there isn\'t too much overlap so that all the documents you\'ve submitted highlight the different aspects of your uniqueness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, have you started on your personal branding strategy? Remember, you want your personal brand to shine through in every document you\'ve submitted!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding ways to boost your application profile?

By doing so, you\'ll be ahead of the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s go through the steps one by one on how to build personal branding for university admission.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Discover Yourself</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can start to explore yourself as early as Grade 9. When we say you need to start early, we mean it! It is the best time to find out your passion and interests. Take a quick look at the past. See what activities you like. Perhaps volunteering plays a big role in your life, or maybe you are a member of the neighborhood beautification committee. All of it matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Research for Potential Activities</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\'t just tell the admissions committee what you like, show them! Once you have already discovered who you are and your interests, you can start searching for potential activities for you. On the other hand, the ultimate way to build personal branding is with a <strong>personal project</strong>. The personal project helps you showcase your unique quality. Moreover, you can find a project that suits your interest and can help make the world a better place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\"><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/how-to-build-personal-branding-for-university-admission/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Do you want to know the greatest way to showcase your personal project?

Some may require a personal statement, while others may require essays, recommendation letters, or even videos. That is to say before you begin working on your application, you should first develop a personal branding strategy. In your application, you want it to be an accurate reflection of yourself so that the admissions officer feels as if he or she has met you in person.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Start by self-reflection&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-reflection lays a great foundation for a good application. Serving as your ‘pre-writing\' session, it shouldn\'t take a long time. You can simply sit down and brainstorm for five minutes. And then you can start building a brief outline of what you want your brand to be, which might include your experiences, perspectives, or perhaps goals for the future.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Putting all the pieces together</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In all of the documents, including the essays, it shouldn\'t feel as if one doesn\'t fit in with the rest or as if each one was written by a different person. Before accepting you into their university, admission officers want to get to know yourself holistically. You have to make sure they all make sense and don\'t contradict one another, but ensure there isn\'t too much overlap so that all the documents you\'ve submitted highlight the different aspects of your uniqueness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\"><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/personal-branding-strategy-perfecting-uni-application/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Curious about the complete strategy?

If you\'re not sure where to start on building your personal brand, check out these personal branding tips!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Understand who you are</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before curating your personal brand, start by thinking about who you truly are, including your goals and values. If you are having trouble understanding yourself, you can ask friends, family, or teachers to help you out. They may provide insights into yourself from a different perspective, helping you to be more aware of your personality and qualities.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Assess your strengths and weaknesses&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You may have heard the saying, ‘keep your friends close and your enemies closer.\' Well, it\'s similar when assessing your strengths and weaknesses. You should be aware of both aspects. In this way, you can dive deeper into the activities that make use of your greatest strengths. On the other hand, you can cross out the activities that don\'t contribute to your goal or purpose.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bonus personal branding tips: Build an accurate digital personal brand&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only do employers look at the social media accounts of potential employees, but so do university admission officers.

That means you need to step up your game and have strong personal branding. But how to build personal branding that can capture yourself well? Here are the steps you can use to help you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A personal brand is a must for university candidates. Without any personal branding, impressing university admissions officers will be very hard. Think about it! A personal brand is what makes you unique and different from other candidates. If you do not have any, nothing is interesting about you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is Personal Branding?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/personal-branding-why-is-it-important-for-students/\">Personal branding</a> refers to how you display yourself in the eyes of the public. In the case of a university application, admission officers are your ‘audience\'. So building a personal brand to make yourself stand out is very important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can think about building your personal brand as early as possible. Even in Grade 9, you can already start preparing for it. You have a year to explore your likes and dislikes, and figure out what makes you stand out. By doing so, you\'ll be ahead of the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s go through the steps one by one on how to build personal branding for university admission.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Discover Yourself</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can start to explore your interests as early as Grade 9. When we say you need to start early, we mean it! It is the best time to find out your passion and interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research and find out more about yourself. Who are you? What makes you different from others? Make a list of your skills, talents, interests, and interests.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are still confused, take a quick look at the past. See what activities you like. Perhaps volunteering plays a big role in your life, or maybe you are a member of the neighborhood beautification committee. All of it matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The secret recipe on how to build a personal brand according to ALL-in Mentors is:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p><strong>Academic Interest + Personal Interest + Strength, Personality, and Core Value</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The combination of these three will demonstrate to the admissions officers your personal qualities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Research Potential Activities</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\'t just tell the admissions committee what you like, show them! Once you have already discovered who you are and your interests, you can start searching for potential activities you can do. The activity can be anything that supports your personal brand. It can be volunteering at your local communities, an internship at a company, or a crash course on some field that interests you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, the ultimate way how to build personal branding is with a <strong>personal project</strong>. The personal project helps you showcase your unique skills, interests, and character. Moreover, you can work on a project that suits your interest and help make the world a better place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of our mentees, Vincent Onggo, has developed a new way to stay germ-free during the pandemic. He notes that one of the surfaces with a high probability of spreading the virus that we often touch is door handles. While cleaning the door handles with disinfectant is common, it is very time-consuming and can damage the door handles if exposed to harsh chemicals too often.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This inspired him to create UVinci; an automatic UV door handles sanitizer to prevent bacteria and virus transmission. When the device\'s motion sensor detects movement, UV light is automatically shone towards the door handle to keep it germ-free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s clear that his project strongly supports his personal brand as an engineer. You can see how creating your own project might strengthen your application!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think? The personal brand makes you stand out more than other candidates, right?

(10118, 'time-management-importance-for-students', 3, 0, 'Time Management Importance for Students', '<p>You may be wondering, what is time management importance for students? Why should we manage our time? I\'ve been managing just fine so far!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To answer it simply, because each of us only has 24 hours a day. There is a saying: either you run the day or the day runs you. To manage time is to take charge of your day. You can achieve more than you think within 24 hours if you manage it properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s break down these 24 hours. We all know that the recommended time for sleep is 8 hours a day, which means we only have 16 hours to stay productive. How you spend those 16 hours is entirely up to you, but good time management can maximize your day and prove beneficial for you as a student. Here are some of the other benefits of time management:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Boost Productivity</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The importance of time management is so that you can increase your productivity. You can do this by effectively managing your time. Assigning a specific time for all things to be completed in a day allows you to plan your day ahead of time and complete more tasks in less time. However, keep in mind that this will only work if you complete your tasks on time; delaying will hurt your productivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Keep You Organized</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest method for students to manage their time is by designing and sticking to a timetable. Additionally, sticking to a timetable will also help you prioritize your tasks. This is beneficial for students because they will have a clear understanding of the many chores that must be completed each day, and they will be able to readily mark the jobs as completed once they have been completed. This will help you organize your daily chores, and you can even prioritize them by putting the most critical ones at the head of your to-do list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Reduce Stress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you have a lengthy list of things to do and not enough time to complete them, you might become anxious. You can prioritize tasks and tackle them first with good time management. You\'ll know exactly what you need to do and how much time you have to finish each assignment this way. You will feel less anxious and stressed because you have ample time to complete everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>More Time for Extracurricular Activities</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you have a set timetable for all of your duties for the day, you can estimate how much time you\'ll have left once you\'ve completed all of them. You can plan your tasks to have more time to accomplish what you enjoy. This can include activities such as drawing, painting, singing, dancing, photography, etc. Aside from that, you can also fill your time by doing a personal project or other refreshing activities like walking or jogging.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Say Good-Bye to Last Minute Cramming</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One issue that students frequently confront is not doing revision regularly throughout the semester. As a result, they end up cramming all of the chapters right before the tests, resulting in lower-than-expected grades. Students who use effective time management skills will be able to revise the material regularly and end up having more time before exams to relax.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/time-management-take-charge-of-your-day/\">time management</a> can also allow you to explore more about yourself and things you like. You can also have enough time to research your future, like university majors or application requirements.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your time wisely and prepare your uni application early with ALL-in!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we can do for you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Maximize your university entrance prep with <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/admissions-mentoring/\"><strong>Admission Mentoring</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li><li>Explore your interests and dive into different industries through <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/passionxplorer/\"><strong>Career Exploration.</strong></a></li><li>Improve your grades and knowledge through <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/academic-test-preparation/\"><strong>Academic Tutoring.</strong></a></li><li>Highlight your personal brand through the <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/writing-skills/\"><strong>Writing Skills</strong></a><strong> </strong>improvement program.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s #TakeOnYourFuture with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/allineduspace/\">ALL-in Eduspace</a>!

You probably don\'t feel like you have enough time to complete all of your homework, projects, and study for tests. But a time management matrix can help you prioritize your work better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s no surprise that many of us want to make better use of our time. The time management matrix helps you understand how you spend your time and productivity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Consider how you now spend your time as a student on various activities throughout a typical day, week, or year. You can use the time management matrix below to start your own as you read through this article.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is the task important?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Essential tasks are those necessary for your success in life. For many people, this means&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Learning and working for a career</li><li>Maintaining and improving one\'s health</li><li>Spending time with family and friends</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Important activities are those that help you achieve your objectives. These can be found in the time management matrix\'s Q1 and Q2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Unimportant tasks</strong> are things that don\'t help you achieve your goals, like</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Surfing the Internet for memes</li><li>Watching a whole season of a TV series</li><li>Browsing social media</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Focusing on these unimportant tasks rather than the important ones leads to a lack of progress as you are not moving towards your goals. These tasks exist in Q3 and Q4.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is the task urgent?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Asking this question is probably a good indicator of the amount of stress you feel like a student. Urgent tasks are close to the deadline and ask you to finish them as quickly as possible. They are Q1 and Q3 tasks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q1 tasks are Urgent/Important, and \'must do\' tasks that require your immediate attention!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Finishing the assessment by the assessment deadline&nbsp;</li><li>Studying for tomorrow\'s exam&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Q3 tasks are not that important but they are asking for your attention. For example,&nbsp; interruptions at home, emails, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Use the matrix to prioritize your time&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, you might dwell on a task longer than you needed. This is because you probably want to clear out the most important and most urgent tasks first. Try to prioritize your time on the important task first, be it urgent or not. On the other hand, the cause of the time management problems is spending too much time in Q3 and Q4. The solution for your time management problems is to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Reduce your time in Q3 and Q4 and spend more time on Q2. Use your academic planner and your study schedule to do this. By spending your time on Q2 activities you devote time to important activities before they become urgent. Don\'t make postponing your responsibility a habit. It will be bad for you in the future.</li><li>Focus your immediate attention in Q1.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Good student time management involves more Q2 time</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You are probably aiming to be as productive as possible with the time management matrix. If good time management involves more in Q2, how can you get more time in this section? You can spend more time in Q2 by&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Clarifying what is essential</li><li>Knowing what your time wasters are</li><li>Using a student planner&nbsp;</li><li>Maintaining good study techniques</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think? A <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/time-management-take-charge-of-your-day/\">time management</a> matrix is important to help you develop a good time management habit. It will help you get your days in order and keep your day from running you.

With a lot on your plate, you may feel overwhelmed balancing everything. Thanks to technological advancements, managing your time has never been easier. From to-do lists to schedule planning, technology can keep you on top of deadlines and amp up your productivity. Let\'s have a look at 4 time management tools you should know!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tomato Timer&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may have an assignment that you\'ve been dreading. Or maybe a university application deadline is approaching, but you haven\'t started working on it yet. Here is where the <a href=\"https://tomato-timer.com/\">Tomato Timer</a> comes in, a web-based tool that draws on the Pomodoro Technique, which divides your time into 25-minute chunks with five-minute breaks in between.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a nutshell, this is how the Pomodoro Technique works:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Choose a task to be done&nbsp;</li><li>Set a timer for 25 minutes</li><li>Work on the task until the timer goes off and take note of where you left off&nbsp;</li><li>Take your 5-minute break – get up, grab a drink, take your mind off the task&nbsp;</li><li>Get back to your task&nbsp;</li><li>After four cycles of Pomodoro, take a longer break!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This technique helps you focus intensely for short bursts of time, which has been found to be more effective than longer, less intense work sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Forest</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Studying while building yourself a virtual forest? That\'s what Forest is. Forest is one of the time management tools available on iOS and Android.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, when you start your study session, you plant a seed. The seed will grow into a tree if you manage to stay off your phone for a set amount of time. At the end of the day, you can look back at your virtual forest and revel in all the work you\'ve completed!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Remember The Milk&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping track of the things you need to do can be difficult.

Aside from keeping all of your notes, ideas, and plans organized in one place, it also syncs across your devices. On top of that, there\'s a collaborative feature that allows you to share and brainstorm ideas with others!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to use time management tools</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The one-size-fits-all mechanism does not apply to all-time management tools. That is to say, if a certain tool isn\'t for you, try something else. Ask yourself these questions to help you find the right time management tools:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What is my biggest barrier with time management?

Perhaps you\'re looking for snacks after finishing a set of questions and end up not regaining your focus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tracking your activities is a good place to start to have a clear picture of how much time you spend on different activities. This allows you to eliminate any time-wasters that may not contribute to any of your work!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Identify your productive ‘time zone\'&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing when you\'re at your most productive allows you to adjust your schedule and take advantage of those periods. If you are most productive at 4 in the afternoon, for example, isolate those productive periods and work on the tasks you need to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\'re unsure when you\'re at your most productive, consider the following questions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>From 1 to 10, how would you rank your mornings, afternoons, and evenings in terms of the energy you have?</li><li>What time of day do you concentrate and focus the most?&nbsp;</li><li>When do you find it easiest to concentrate and focus?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Prioritize your tasks&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the time management tips you should know is using the <strong>Eisenhower Matrix </strong>to separate your tasks. The framework lies upon two elements: urgency and importance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Urgent tasks are those that demand your immediate attention and are time-sensitive (there is a deadline). On the other hand, important tasks are those that contribute to your long-term goals and values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group your tasks into four categories using the Eisenhower Matrix:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Urgent + Important: Do it now&nbsp;</li><li>Not Urgent + Important: Schedule a time to do it&nbsp;</li><li>Urgent + Not Important: Delegate the tasks</li><li>Not Urgent + Not Important: Eliminate the tasks&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn how to use the Eisenhower Matrix, check out this article!\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bonus time management tips: Timebox important tasks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may probably face a situation where a 30-minute task gets out of control and occupies your entire day. Thankfully, you won\'t be facing this problem any longer if you timebox your schedule.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Timeboxing is a method of allocating a specific amount of time to finish a particular task. It is like scheduling a meeting; when the scheduled time arrives, you\'ll have to carry out the task within the allotted time. However, if you still find yourself going over your time limits after timeboxing your schedule, take a look at your workflow and decide whether you need to allocate more time on those tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There you have it—<a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/time-management-take-charge-of-your-day/\">time management</a> tips to get yourself in the productivity game.

Wonder how they can achieve a lot more things than you despite both of you having the same 24 hours a day? That is because they are good at time management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The practice of managing and planning how to split your time between various activities is known as time management. When you get it right, you\'ll find yourself working smarter rather than harder to get more done in less time, even when time is short and pressures are high.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why is it Important?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to manage your time is an important skill that will get you far in life. It helps you maximize your day to the fullest. Good time management holds a lot of benefits for you. Those benefits are:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Boost Productivity</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/time-management-importance-for-students/\">The importance of time management</a> is so that you can increase your productivity. You can do this by effectively managing your time. Assigning a specific time for all things to be completed in a day allows you to plan your day ahead of time and complete more tasks in less time. However, keep in mind that this will only work if you complete your task on time; delaying will hurt your productivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Keeps You Organized</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest method for students to manage their time is by designing and sticking to a timetable. Additionally, sticking to a timetable will also help you prioritize your tasks. This is beneficial for students because they will have a clear understanding of the many chores that must be completed each day, and they will be able to readily mark the jobs as completed once they have been completed. This will help you organize your daily chores, and you can even prioritize them by putting the most critical ones at the head of your to-do list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Reduce Stress</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you have a lengthy list of things to do and not enough time to complete them, you might become anxious. You can prioritize tasks and tackle them first with good time management. You\'ll know exactly what you need to do and how much time you have to finish each assignment this way. You will feel less anxious and stressed because you have ample time to complete everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\"><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/time-management-importance-for-students/\">Find out the other benefits of time management in this article</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How do you do it?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you become more productive in a day?

It\'s now commonly used by businesses and people to discover time wasters and prioritize vital tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See the table below to see what the time management matrix is.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>From the table above you can see that the time management matrix divides your tasks into four categories based on their importance and urgency. This matrix is one of the best ways for you to be more organized and keep you from procrastinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/how-to-use-time-management-matrix/\">See the full detail on how to use the time management matrix here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Maximize it with tools</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The preparation and the procedure of setting a timetable are challenging and time-consuming. Therefore, using tools to help you manage your time can save you a lot of time and work. This means it can help you be more productive. Take a look at these tools that you can use to help you manage your time better:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tomato Timer</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be faced with an assignment that you\'ve been dreading.

Here comes <a href=\"https://tomato-timer.com/\">Tomato Timer</a>, a web-based tool that draws on the Pomodoro Technique, which divides your time into 25-minute work chunks with five-minute breaks in between.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Forest</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Studying while building yourself a virtual forest? That\'s what Forest is. Forest is one of the time management tools available on iOS and Android. Basically, when you start your study session, you plant a seed. The seed will grow into a tree if you manage to stay off your phone for a set amount of time. At the end of the day, you can look back at your virtual forest and revel in all the work you\'ve completed!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Remember The Milk&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping track of the things you need to do can be difficult.

However, with plenty of volunteering opportunities out there, it can be overwhelming to figure out which one best suits your personality, interests and values. Let\'s explore the different types of volunteering work you can do!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Types of volunteering work</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the most common types of volunteering work fall into Environment, Animals, Education, dan Healthcare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under these areas, you can find a variety of volunteer activities and organizations you can get involved in. While volunteering is usually linked with in-person activities, the pandemic has opened a new world of volunteerism: virtual volunteering. Furthermore, Virtual volunteering involves using technology to volunteer for an organization or cause from the comfort of your home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Environment&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the effects of climate change becoming more visible around the world - melting ice caps, extreme weather and dying ecosystems - there\'s never been a more important time to get involved. Moreover, you can join environmental groups to raise awareness of the impacts of climate change on social media, participate in weekly climate strikes, or help to create political change.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Animals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it\'s saving stray animals or victims of animal abuse and natural disasters, you\'ll assist in the care of dogs, cats, and other animals. Feeding animals, dog walking, and cage cleaning are just a few of the responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Education&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In underdeveloped cities, where there may be disparities in access to education, you can pave the way for young children to have a better life. By volunteering as a teacher, you\'ll be responsible for teaching classes, developing curricula, assigning tasks to students, as well as grading students\' performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Healthcare</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hospitals and clinics facing difficulties in keeping track of their patients\' insurance, history, and billing information. Therefore, you may be in charge of digitally organizing medical records. In addition to learning medical terminologies, you\'ll also get to develop highly sought-after data entry skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from that, you can also organize workshops, where you raise awareness on issues such as HIV/AIDS, or the importance of exercising.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What you should know before starting a volunteering work</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before jumping into volunteering, you should first figure out the volunteering work that suits you best. After all, volunteering can be a really fulfilling experience when it\'s done right. Here\'s what you can do:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Understand your goals and expectations. With numerous volunteering opportunities, step back and ask yourself what you want to get out of volunteering. Do you want to improve the lives of your local neighborhood? Or perhaps you\'d like to improve your communication skills?</li><li>Know your skills. Therefore, ask yourself in what ways can you offer yourself? Just like knowing what you get, knowing what you give helps you narrow down the volunteer opportunities that would be a good fit for you.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Thinking of getting involved in volunteering work?

(10174, 'volunteering-experience-why-it-brings-many-benefits', 7, 0, 'Volunteering Experience: Why It Brings Many Benefits', '<p>You\'ve probably heard it from your parents, teachers, or even friends: volunteering is actually worth the time. Aside from giving you something to put on your CV, there are a lot of benefits of having volunteering experience. Without much ado, let\'s find out!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Develop your communication skills and confidence&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people are natural extroverts, while others can have a hard time meeting new people. If you fall into the latter category, volunteering can be a great, fulfilling way to develop and practice your social skills. It not only exposes you to people who share your interests, but it also boosts your confidence by giving you a sense of accomplishment after helping those in need.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Learn new skills</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you\'re still a high school student, volunteering experience can help you develop an array of soft skills you wouldn\'t get in the classroom. Here are a few examples:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Problem-solving - Volunteering projects can be challenging, especially when they must be completed in a short amount of time. Your problem-solving skills will be put to the test as a volunteer since you will need to make decisions in order for the project to be completed successfully.</li><li>Time-management - When working on time-bound projects as a volunteer, not only will you develop the ability to manage your time effectively, you\'ll also learn to prioritize and find out the best approach to fulfil all tasks.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gain a mentor (and letter of recommendations)&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By volunteering, you get to work with individuals who can guide and encourage you in life. Keep a list of the contacts you made while volunteering. These people might help you later in life, perhaps when you need letters of recommendation, references, and job opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Making a difference</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even contributing to the simplest tasks like helping out at a local library, dog shelter or orphanages, you are making your community a better place. After all, every little step that you take towards helping others fulfils a need, and the more steps you take, the more needs are fulfilled!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The importance of volunteering experience in university admissions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever wondered why colleges and universities ask about your extra-curricular activities? Well, they do so for a reason.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volunteering experience demonstrates your initiative and commitment to help others in your community – be it your neighbourhood, city, or country. Furthermore, that\'s what colleges are looking for in a student – someone who will go above and beyond what is required of themselves, and who makes a difference in their community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn\'t matter whether you volunteer at a homeless shelter, host a charity event or tutor primary students; what matters is that you display your commitment to a cause or organization that you believe in. Admission officers want to see more about you than just your SAT scores, essays, and letters of recommendation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding the right volunteer experience</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many volunteer opportunities to choose from, the key is to select one that you\'re capable of doing and that matches your commitment. Here are a few questions you can ask yourself:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What impact do I want to make?</li><li>What are my goals for volunteering?</li><li>How much time am I willing to commit?</li><li>What skills can I offer?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking for a way to start volunteering, you can do it by joining our <strong>Medical & Research Community Service Program</strong>! During this 14-day program, you will have the opportunity and guidance to help the community at <strong>Kei Island, Maluku. </strong>Interested? <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/allineduspacecontact\">Contact us now!</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Searching for volunteering experience?

Do you only want to remember the days of having homework and assignments? Or do you want to remember the days when you had fun volunteering <em>and</em> did well for the community?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to remember both, start filling your high school days with volunteering! Not only is it a rewarding way to spend your free time; it allows you to make a difference in someone else\'s life!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/volunteering-experience-why-it-brings-many-benefits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"What are the benefits of volunteering (opens in a new tab)\">What are the benefits of volunteering</a>?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, why the interest in volunteering? Why would anyone want to spend their time and energy to serve and help others? And more importantly, how will it benefit you? From gaining new skills to building your confidence, there are many reasons why volunteering is worth your time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The importance of volunteering experience in university admissions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever wondered why colleges and universities ask about your extra-curricular activities? Well, they do so for a reason.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volunteering experience demonstrates your initiative and commitment to help others in your community – be it your neighborhood, city, or country. That\'s what colleges are looking for in a student – someone who will go above and beyond what is required of themselves, and who makes a difference in their community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn\'t matter whether you volunteer at a homeless shelter, host a charity event or tutor primary students; what matters is that you display your commitment to a cause or organization that you believe in. Admission officers want to see more about you than just your SAT scores, essays, and letters of recommendation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Learn new skills</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you\'re still a high school student, volunteering experience can help you develop an array of soft skills you wouldn\'t get in the classroom. Here are a few examples:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Problem-solving - Volunteering projects can be challenging, especially when they must be completed in a short amount of time. Your problem-solving skills will be put to the test as a volunteer since you will need to make decisions for the project to be completed successfully.</li><li>Time-management - When working on time-bound projects as a volunteer, not only will you develop the ability to manage your time effectively, you\'ll also learn to prioritize and find out the best approach to fulfill all tasks.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\"><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/volunteering-experience-why-it-brings-many-benefits/\">Curious about what other benefits you can get from volunteering?

You can help rebuild houses, teach homeless children how to read and write or feed them meals. The key is to volunteer according to your goals and skills so you spend your time doing something worthwhile and enjoyable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the most common types of volunteering work:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Environmental</li><li>Animals</li><li>Education&nbsp;</li><li>Healthcare</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Under these areas, you can find a variety of volunteer activities and organizations you can get involved in. While volunteering is usually linked with in-person activities, the pandemic has opened a new world of volunteerism: virtual volunteering. Virtual volunteering, as the name suggests, involves using technology to volunteer for an organization or cause from the comfort of your home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\"><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/types-of-volunteering-work-for-high-school-students/\">Get deep into the different types of volunteering work by checking out this article</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volunteering is one of those things that can impact your life in ways that you would have never imagined.

Sudah bukan rahasia juga bahwa biaya kuliah di Belanda jauh lebih besar dibanding biaya kuliah di Indonesia. Maka dari itu, penting untuk kamu untuk mengetahui rincian biaya di bawah ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pendidikan Tinggi di Belanda diatur oleh pemerintah dan berkualitas tinggi. Bahkan menurut Universitas21, sebuah jaringan global yang yang menyatukan 27 universitas intensif penelitian terkemuka, Belanda berada di urutan ke-7 dunia. Belanda menjadi tuan rumah bagi hampir 90.000 pelajar asing setiap tahun, dan meskipun bukan bahasa resmi negara tersebut, hampir 95% penduduk setempat dapat berkomunikasi dalam bahasa Inggris.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dengan kata lain, seharusnya agak lebih mudah untuk mendapatkan teman baru dan berintegrasi dengan cepat. Selain itu, individu dengan visa pelajar diizinkan untuk bekerja hingga 16 jam per minggu selama studi mereka dan penuh waktu selama hari libur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simak rincian biaya kuliah di Belanda berikut ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Biaya Universitas</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Biaya kuliah di Belanda cukup unik, karena biaya tersebut akan tergantung pada negara tempat asalmu. Jika kamu berasal dari EU/EEA, Swiss, atau Suriname, kamu akan mendapat manfaat dari biaya kuliah yang lebih rendah di universitas negeri Belanda. Biaya biasanya berkisar antara € 700 - 2.100 per tahun akademik, dan biaya tersebut dipengaruhi oleh universitas tempat kamu belajar, disiplin ilmu, dan jenis gelar (Sarjana, Master, atau PhD).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Untuk semua pelajar internasional (yang tidak berasal dari EU/EEA) lainnya, biaya kuliah akan sedikit lebih tinggi. Kamu perlu mengeluarkan biaya antara:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>€ 6,000 - 15,000 per tahun untuk gelar Sarjana</li><li>€ 8,000 - 20,000 per tahun untuk gelar Master</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Di sisi lain, jika kamu mendaftar di universitas swasta Belanda, kamu biasanya membutuhkan anggaran yang lebih besar. Untuk beberapa program studi, kamu dapat mengharapkan untuk membayar sebanyak € 30.000 per tahun. Kedokteran dan Bisnis adalah beberapa kursus yang paling mahal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Biaya Hidup</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Selain biaya kuliah, salah satu biaya yang akan kamu keluarkan adalah biaya hidup. Hal ini tergantung dengan gaya hidup kamu dan seberapa konsumtif kamu selama di sana. Kamu harus mempersiapkannya jauh-jauh hari. Seperti biaya tempat tinggal, makanan, dan hiburan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Berikut adalah lampiran biaya hidup yang mungkin kamu butuhkan di sana:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Akomodasi</strong>: Biaya menyewa kamar di Belanda akan berkisar antara € 300 – 600 per bulan. Kontrakan mahasiswa akan lebih terjangkau sekitar € 350 - 600 per bulan, dan beberapa universitas bahkan menawarkan akomodasi di dalam kampus. Universitas tempatmu berkuliah akan membantumu memilih akomodasi, kamu hanya perlu menelpon saat sudah dinyatakan masuk ke universitas tersebut. Pilihan lain adalah menyewa satu flat atau berbagi apartemen yang lebih besar, tetapi harganya lebih tinggi. Harganya bisa mencapai € 500 - 1.000/bulan.</li><li><strong>Makanan</strong>: Pelajar yang tinggal sendiri membayar sekitar € 150 - 170 per bulan untuk makanan dan bahan makanan. Lidl, Aldi dan Albert Heijn adalah beberapa supermarket terjangkau yang bisa kamu jadikan tempat belanja. Berapa banyak yang kamu belanjakan tergantung pada gaya hidup kamu dan kota tempat kamu tinggal. Contohnya, biaya belanja kebutuhan sehari-hari di Amsterdam dan Rotterdam akan lebih mahal daripada di kota-kota kecil seperti Groningen atau Eindhoven. Jika kamu suka makan restoran, kamu perlu menyiapkan anggaran sekitar € 10 - 20.</li><li><strong>Internet</strong>: Biaya ini tentu saja termasuk yang paling penting di jaman sekarang. Untuk berlangganan internet, kamu akan mengeluarkan biaya sekitar € 30 - 50 per bulan.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Biaya Transportasi</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Di Belanda, rata-rata biaya transportasi bulanan bus/kereta untuk pelajar adalah € 35 - 70 per bulan. Sebagai seorang pelajar, kamu juga bisa mendapat <em>student discount</em> di OV-chipkaart (kartu transportasi Belanda). Kamu dapat menghemat uang dengan menyewa sepeda. Sepeda merupakan salah satu moda transportasi yang populer di negara ini. Untuk menyewa sepeda, kamu perlu mengeluarkan biaya sekitar € 10 per hari.

Kuliah di luar negeri membutuhkan beberapa dokumen penting yang wajib untuk kamu sediakan saat mendaftar di universitas. Syarat kuliah di Belanda sangat bervariasi, dan bahkan ada beberapa yang memerlukan perhatian lebih lho. Ayo simak di bawah ini!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salah satu alasan kenapa syarat kuliah di Belanda banyak adalah karena mutu pendidikan mereka yang masuk dalam kualitas dunia. Di sisi lain, universitas negeri di Belanda mempunyai beberapa peraturan khusus yang hanya berlaku bagi pelajar yang berasal dari negara khusus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perlu diingat bahwa tidak sembarang orang bisa diterima masuk ke universitas yang ada di sana. Berbeda dari Indonesia, nilai bagus saja tidak menjamin kamu bisa masuk ke sana.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simak beberapa persyaratan yang perlu kamu penuhi untuk bisa kuliah di Belanda:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>1. IELTS atau TOEFL</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Untuk kuliah di Inggris, kamu juga wajib untuk mengikuti tes IELTS atau TOEFL. Tujuan diadakannya tes ini adalah untuk menguji seberapa baik tingkat pengetahuan bahasa inggrismu. Sebagai pelajar yang melanjutkan studi di Inggris, tentu saja kamu akan melakukan proses pembelajaran dalam bahasa Inggris. Kamu bisa mendapatkan nilai IELTS atau TOEFL ini dari beberapa lembaga yang menyediakan jasa tersebut. Sudah banyak lembaga di Indonesia yang menyediakan tes IELTS atau TOEFL. Namun beberapa universitas tidak memberlakukan hal ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. <strong>Transkrip Nilai</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Transkrip Nilai adalah kumpulan semua nilai kamu selama kamu bersekolah. Dokumen ini mencakup nilai secara keseluruhan dari kelas 9 sampai kamu lulus. Tujuan diperlukannya dokumen ini adalah supaya staf universitas tersebut dapat mengetahui secara garis besar tentang performa akademikmu selama bersekolah. Jadi, pastikan kamu untuk rajin belajar sejak awal ya!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. <strong>Passport</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Syarat yang satu ini akan berhubungan dengan biaya universitas di Belanda. Identitas ini diperlukan untuk mencari tahu apakah kamu merupakan pelajar yang berasal dari negara anggota EU/EEA. Hal ini karena pelajar yang berasa dari negara EU/EEA akan dikenakan biaya uang kuliah yang lebih rendah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. <strong>Surat Rekomendasi</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Surat Rekomendasi Perguruan Tinggi adalah surat dukungan agar kamu diterima di universitas yang kamu tuju. Dokumen ini berisi pernyataan formal singkat yang harus menonjolkan kualitas positif dan menjelaskan mengapa kamu akan berhasil dalam studi perguruan tinggi. Surat rekomendasi yang baik biasanya ditulis oleh guru atau atasan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. <strong><em>Motivation Letter</em></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Surat motivasi adalah cara bagi kamu untuk menjelaskan kepada staf penerima bahwa&nbsp; kamu cocok untuk jurusan dan universitas yang kamu lamar. Ini adalah kesempatan bagi kamu untuk menggambarkan secara pribadi motivasi kamu untuk melamar dan pengalaman apa yang bisa membawamu sampai mendaftar ke universitas yang kamu pilih.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syarat kuliah di Belanda memang bervariasi.

Luckily, internships are here not only to give you a glimpse of the professional world but also to explore different career paths and skills. Let\'s take a closer look at the benefits of having internship experience!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is an internship?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An internship is a professional learning opportunity where you can gain hands-on experience and develop specific skills in a certain industry. Internships usually last for a semester, summer break, or school year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why is it important to gain internship experience?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Figure out what works for you</strong> - Working and living the life of a professional allows you to understand more about yourself while also helping you decide if a particular line of work is a good fit for your lifestyle, goals, and the type of work you enjoy. In this way, you can save time and money on training for a profession that doesn\'t suit you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gain professional skills</strong> - No matter what industry your internship is in, you\'ll develop skills like communication, teamwork, and time management, which can be applied to other fields.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Build confidence</strong> - The transition from the classroom to the workplace may fill you with anxiety and fear.

Make a list of the subjects in which you excel or enjoy and the activities you participate most in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Build a Curriculum Vitae (CV) or résumé</strong> - If you think CVs or résumés are for experienced professionals, it\'s not! As a high school student, you can start working on your CV or résumé to apply for internships. Make a list of your achievements, remarkable projects, or even experiences. If you have no work experience yet, highlight your involvement in clubs, the student body, or a sports team.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do your research</strong> - Search for companies or organizations that work in a similar field of your interests. You can also reach out to families, friends, or relatives for internship suggestions based on your interests.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if it\'s not in the industry you want to work in, try to seize every opportunity to do an <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/the-ins-and-outs-of-internship/\">internship</a>.

Save all that headache; we\'ll find out what a motivation letter for internships is and what it includes!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is a motivation letter for internships?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A motivation letter is a letter of introduction that explains why you are the most suitable candidate for a certain position and how you can contribute to the organization. It is usually accompanied by another document, such as a Curriculum Vitae (CV) or a résumé.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, why does it matter? While your CV or résumé presents your strengths, skills, and achievements, it doesn\'t offer a glimpse of your aspirations or motivation. This is where a motivation letter comes in, as it serves to tell the recruiter your story.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A motivation letter helps the recruiter get to know you as a person, instead of just the compelling grades or achievements found on your résumé or CV. That means, in your motivation letter, try to include the reasons behind your decision to apply, as well as how your interests and aspirations match the position you\'re applying for.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Structure of a motivation letter for internships</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While there is no specific formula for writing a motivation letter for internships, it is ideally one page long.

Also, let them know that you are available to chat with them further or answer any questions they may have.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tips for writing a motivation letter</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do some research</strong> - Learn the ins and outs about the company or organization. Knowing the details and mentioning facts about the company or organization demonstrates your genuine interest in the position and shows that you are well-informed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\'t copy others</strong> - If you read several motivation letters, you might notice that one differs from another. Well, the whole point of a motivation letter lies in its uniqueness. Therefore, make sure you\'re not copying someone else\'s style of writing when you\'re writing your motivation letter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Proofread and check for spelling</strong> - After you\'ve finished writing your motivation letter, go over it again and make sure you don\'t make any grammatical errors. After all, one of the soft skills required for most professions is written communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, write a motivation letter that uniquely and holistically portrays yourself, both in terms of your accomplishments and your personality.

There are many different types of jobs within the field and dozens of ways to get involved once you have acquired tertiary education in it. This article will provide an overview of psychology jobs for those who have an interest in pursuing a career within the mental health profession.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the overall employment in the psychology field is expanding from 2020 to 2030 at a rate of 8%, which is roughly the same as the average for all occupations. Over the next ten years, there are expected to be over 13,400 opportunities for psychologists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the most famous paths you can choose for psychology jobs:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Psychologist</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Psychologists work on a wide range of themes relating to how individuals think, feel, and behave through research, practice, and teaching. They can work with individuals, organizations, families, and larger government and industrial organizations. Some psychologists prefer to study animals rather than humans. In order to be a psychologist, you need to complete a bachelor\'s degree in psychology.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Psychotherapist</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To address mental health issues, psychotherapy is frequently used in conjunction with medication. For many people, a combination of medication and psychotherapy is preferable to either one alone. Psychotherapy helps clients manage their emotional, social, and mental problems by using evidence-based therapies to change their behavior.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A psychotherapist needs further education than a psychologist. Psychotherapy candidates must earn an advanced degree to complete all the necessary requirements. After that, you also need to complete a set number of clinical hours, pass a licensing exam, and then become certified to practice psychotherapy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Human Resources</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Human resources (HR) is a corporate division responsible for locating, screening, hiring, and training job candidates, as well as administering employee benefit programs. In the twenty-first century, HR plays a critical role in assisting businesses in dealing with a rapidly changing business climate and a higher demand for quality personnel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the most common career paths for a psychology degree. In this field, you are not only dealing with hiring new employees but also maintaining the employee\'s satisfaction in the office. So, you are responsible to optimize the effectiveness of the employee. If you want to work in HR, you need at least to finish a bachelor\'s degree.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Researcher</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you familiar with the theory of human behavior? Or you may have also heard about the theory of personality development. It is not news that researchers discover new theories every day. As a researcher, you will be a part of a great opportunity to use scientific methods to discover new things about human interaction and behaviors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research psychologists publish their findings in peer-reviewed publications, present their findings at conferences, and give speeches at symposiums. Research psychologists might work as lecturers, practitioners, or advisors in addition to conducting studies and experiments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Lecturer</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the psychology jobs that you can choose is a lecturer. As a lecturer, you are responsible for passing the knowledge of human behavior to the next generation. It is not only limited to that. You will also need to be passionate about what you do to be able to inspire your students.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be a lecturer, you need to complete both your undergraduate degree and master\'s degree. It might be better if you could improve your education further to be able to spread more knowledge to young people who are also passionate to learn about human behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many possible career paths for a Psychology graduate. The field revolves around helping people deal with their own issues, helping them cope with the expectations of society and life. There are some paths that revolve around education, which inspires and teaches many youngsters through many different methods of learning. In conclusion, psychology is about studying the way a person thinks and reacts to certain stimuli. It is about helping a person reach the full potential in their own personality and outlook on life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interested in getting the best <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/psychology-the-famous-major-for-students/\">psychology</a> degree in the world?

Lalu, hakim di peradilan agama menangani perkara antara orang-orang yang beragama Islam. Terakhir, hakim di peradilan militer menangani perkara tindak pidana militer. Dalam melaksanakan tugas peradilan, seorang hakim tidak diperbolehkan untuk membeda-bedakan orang dan harus menghormati asas praduga tak bersalah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Konsultan Hukum</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Konsultan Hukum Satu lagi istilah yang sudah sering kita dengar.

Tindakan dan perbuatan hukum yang dimaksudkan adalah diluar pengadilan.

Dalam UU No.2 Tahun 2014 Pasal 1 ayat 1 disebutkan, pengertian notaris adalah pejabat umum yang mempunyai kewenangan membuat akta autentik serta memiliki wewenang lain seperti yang dimaksud dalam UU tersebut atau berdasarkan UU lainnya.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Mediator</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Profesi yang satu ini belum banyak dikenal oleh orang-orang lho. Padahal di satu sisi, mediator ini memiliki berperan penting dalam proses mediasi pada suatu kasus yang sedang terjadi. Mediator sendiri dalam KBBI memiliki arti sebagai perantara (penghubung, penengah).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mediator bisa dikatakan pihak netral yang membantu para pihak dalam proses perundingan guna mencari berbagai kemungkinan penyelesaian sengketa tanpa menggunakan cara memutus atau memaksakan sebuah penyelesaian.

Tradisi hukum di daratan Eropa mengenal pembagian hukum menjadi dua yakni hukum publik dan hukum privat atau hukum perdata. Dalam sistem Anglo-Saxon tidak dikenal pembagian semacam ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Menurut <strong>Prof. Subekti</strong>, hukum perdata merupakan semua hukum privat materiil berupa segala hukum pokok mengatur kepentingan perseorangan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contoh Hukum perdata diantaranya adalah: utang piutang, masalah warisan, sengketa lahan tanah, sengketa kepemilikan barang, perebutan hak asuh anak, pelanggaran hak paten, pencemaran nama baik dan lain sebagainya.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Hukum Pidana</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dari banyaknya macam-macam jurusan hukum, ini merupakan salah satu yang paling populer. Hukum pidana adalah dari hukum positif yang telah berlaku disuatu negara yang memperhatikan waktu, tempat dan bagian penduduk yang memuat beberapa dasar dan ketentuan mengenai tindakan larangan atau tindakan kekerasan. Para pelanggar hukum ini bisa&nbsp; diancam dengan pidana.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hukum ini menentukan pula bagaimana dan dalam hal apa pelaku pelanggaran tersebut dipertanggungjawabkan serta ketentuan-ketentuan mengenai hal dan cara penyelidik, penuntutan, penjatuhan pidana dan pelaksanaan pidana demi tegaknya hukum yang bertitik berat kepada keadilan. Perumusan hukum pidana mencakup juga hukum pidana adat, yang bertujuan mengadakan keseimbangan antara berbagai kepentingan atau keadilan</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salah satu contoh hukum pidana adalah kasus nenek Minah yang dinyatakan bersalah pada tanggal 19 November 2009 karena memetik tiga buah kakao di perkebunan PT Rumpun Sari Antan (RSA), Ajibarang, Banyumas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Hukum Ekonomi</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hukum ekonomi adalah keseluruhan kaidah-kaidah dan putusan-putusan hukum yang secara khusus mengatur kegiatan bisnis dan kegiatan ekonomi di Indonesia</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Istilah bisnis terfokus pada pelaku dan pengusaha yang berada di lapangan untuk menyelenggarakan aktivitas bisnis. Pengertian bisnis tersebut memiliki arti yang lebih luas daripada perdagangan yakni investasi, produksi, pemasaran serta pembiayaan</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Hukum Internasional</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Menurut Prof. Dr Muhammad Ashri, S.H., M.H. dan Rapung Samuddin, Lc. M.A. dalam buku “Hukum Internasional dan Hukum Islam tentang Sengketa dan Perdamaian” karya disebutkan bahwa Hukum internasional dapat dibagi menjadi dua bidang, yaitu hukum internasional publik dan hukum perdata internasional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hukum perdata Internasional adalah keseluruhan kaidah dan asas hukum yang mengatur hubungan keperdataan yang melintasi batas negara, atau hukum yang mengatur hubungan keperdataan antara subjek hukum masing-masing tunduk pada hukum perdata yang berlainan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sementara itu, Hukum Internasional Publik adalah keseluruhan kaidah dan asas hukum yang mengatur hubungan atau persoalan yang melintasi batas negara (hubungan internasional) yang bukan bersifat perdata.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salah satu contoh permasalahan hukum internasional adalah sengketa Laut China Selatan. Wilayah seluas 3 juta meter persegi di Laut China Selatan yang bersebelahan dengan wilayah Filipina, Malaysia, dan Vietnam. Wilayah ini pernah diperebutkan beberapa negara tersebut.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Hukum Administrasi Negara</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hukum Administrasi Negara adalah keseluruhan peraturan yang mengatur tentang aparatur pemerintah dalam melakukan berbagai aktivitas atau tugas-tugas negara, guna mencapai tujuan yang telah ditentukan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oleh karena itu, bagi aparatur pemerintah baik di pusat maupun di daerah dalam memberikan pelayanan kepada masyarakat tetap berpegang kepada peraturan perundang-undangan yang berlaku.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jurusan hukum mempunyai banyak macamnya dan masing-masing merupakan bidang yang cukup luas untuk bisa kamu selami.

Let\'s check out Madeline\'s Elysian Esse Shop project below!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Background&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To spread mental health awareness, Madeline plans on selling items that surround the idea of positivity and loving oneself. But it\'s not just about spreading awareness: the collected funds will later be donated to charity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Initiatives&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Madeline\'s project started with brainstorming issues surrounding society. With all the information gathered, mental health was the one that had the potential to be further developed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the first things that Madeline did was go through the planning process to determine the possible items to be sold. After narrowing the items down, she started making set designs and her shop\'s logo.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Product&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though it\'s still in the early stages, Madeline has started executing her project by opening social media and online marketplace accounts and creating content such as promotional posters and advertisements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, her online shop was ready to launch. She has uploaded several posts on her shop\'s social media account and has started taking pre-orders. To keep everything in order, she created a systemised database in a spreadsheet to store customer information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As stated before, Madeline\'s project was not just about generating funds—she also wanted to do something good for society. After delivering all the sold goods, Madeline donated the revenues to charity. In addition, she has started promoting the next batch of goods to be sold later.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Future Plan</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future, Madeline plans to conduct a survey of the audience and promote her project to reach a larger audience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Judge\'s Comment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Madeline\'s idea is more than just a clothing line; it\'s also a platform for mental health education, which is a critical issue in today\'s society. She has also developed a detailed and clear plan, from brainstorming the topics to creating the products. And now, people can find her products on social media and online marketplaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mental health is very important for us humans. Furthermore, the problem is not many people are aware that we have to be able to show our emotions to keep our mental health in check.

Therefore, with the belief that nature is a human responsibility, she plans on educating the public on eco enzymes and their benefits for the environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Initiatives&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To get started, Laurentia conducted comprehensive research on eco enzymes. This is including what they are, the different types of eco enzymes, their benefits, and how they are made. Furthermore, She made her batch of eco enzyme samples using organic waste materials. After successfully creating her samples, Laurentia packed them into spray bottles and distributed them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laurentia also started a social media account to reach a greater audience where she shares content about eco enzymes. She takes the time to show how it\'s made and its uses and benefits. All these efforts align with her aim of educating the public and inspiring them to make sustainable changes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Product&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first 6 months, Laurentia has expanded her team by recruiting three new members. Along with her newly-expanded team, she has taken her project to a new level: Laurentia has started promoting the product through the aforementioned social media account and webinars.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the past few months, Laurentia and her team have reached out to local eco-enzyme communities. Not only that, but she has also upgraded the social media account by uploading eco enzyme news updates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Future Plan</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After expanding her team, Laurentia plans to build a connection with more eco enzyme communities. Also, she conducts a campaign about eco enzymes to reach a more significant number of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Judge\'s Comment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Aside from being eco-friendly, the product has many uses, one of which is disinfecting surfaces. Laurencia has also carefully executed her project, starting with the creation of the brand. Then, she decide on the distribution channel. Lastly, she started a social media account for the project. She not only started her project in order to sell her eco enzymes, but also to educate people about it through social media.\'&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making eco enzyme means that we reuse some of our organic waste and use it for our other needs. Therefore, Laurentia put her passion and knowledge to educate many people about the benefits of Eco Enzym.

New basic and clinical sciences departments were founded, a three-year degree program was introduced, and the apprenticeship system was removed. HMS became a professional school of Harvard University, establishing the standard for medical education within a university in the United States.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A glance at Harvard Medical School&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With a single campus and an online presence, Harvard Medical School offers numerous programs.

He grew up in a little town called Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, England. Moreover, he was an English chemist, medical doctor, scientific instrument developer, and author best known for creating the Gaia hypothesis, which holds that all life on Earth is a part of an entity that regulates the planet\'s surface and atmospheric processes. Lovelock also invented several chemical-detection gadgets, such as the electron-capture detector (ECD).<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paul Zamecnik</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paul Charles Zamecnik (November 22, 1912 – October 27, 2009) was an American molecular biologist who played a vital role in the early development of the field. Moreover, Zamecnik pioneered protein synthesis in vitro and contributed to understanding how cells produce proteins. Furthermore, he was a senior scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of medicine at HMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harvard Medical School is much more than just another prestigious academic institution. It is one of the oldest medical schools in the modern world, but it was also the first to campaign openly for racial and gender inclusion.

With a history that\'s nearly 400 years long, Harvard retains its reputation as one of the leading universities in the world. Now, let us look at one of Harvard\'s distinguished schools: Harvard Law School.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>History of Harvard Law School</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With a history dating back to the early 1800s, Harvard Law School (HLS) is the oldest continuously operating law school in the United States. Situated in Cambridge, Massachusetts, it is home to the largest academic law library in the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harvard Law School was one of the first law schools to admit women, beginning with the class of 1950. Among the nine women who enrolled at HLS in 1956 was Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who went on to become an Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court, where she served until her death in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A glance at Harvard Law School&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Harvard Law School offers three types of graduate degrees:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Juris Doctor (J.D.):</strong> A full-time, three-year program where students get to learn the fundamentals of legal practice, legal reasoning, and analysis.

According to Harvard Law School\'s 2022 class profile, 916 applicants were offered admissions out of 7,419 applicants. This brings the admissions rate to only 12%.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Degree and Programs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Harvard Law School\'s faculty includes more than 100 full-time professors and more than 150 visiting professors. They offer more than 400 courses and seminars covering a broad range of traditional and emerging legal fields.

After graduating, he worked as a civil rights attorney and taught at the University of Chicago before deciding to run for public office. In 2008, after serving three years in the US Senate, he became the 44th President of the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elena Kagan</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1986, Elena Kagan clerked for Thurgood Marshall, who was then a Justice of the Supreme Court. After the end of her clerkship, she became an attorney at Williams & Connolly and later served as the dean of Harvard Law School from 2003.

UCLA\'s academic roots started back in 1882, when it was originally founded as the southern branch of the California State Normal School. Moreover, UCLA is one of nine public undergraduate campuses across the state, from the Bay Area down to San Diego.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What majors is UCLA known for?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With a total enrollment of 31,543 undergraduate students, UCLA offers 125 undergraduate majors spread across 109 academic departments and over 90 minors.&nbsp;Therefore, you can say that the university is one of the favorite destinations for students.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the most popular undergraduate majors in UCLA:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Biology&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>UCLA\'s Biology program is part of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB).

Hal ini karena sudah terbukti bahwa kualitas pendidikan di luar negeri jauh lebih bagus dibanding di dalam negeri. Selain itu, <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/id/kuliah-di-luar-negeri-udah-bukan-mimpi/\">kuliah di luar negeri</a> juga mempersiapkan kita agar bisa bersaing di pasar internasional. Penasaran? Berikut adalah beberapa cara kuliah di luar negeri dengan beasiswa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mungkin bagi kita para pelajar, beasiswa merupakan salah satu atau bahkan satu-satunya cara untuk beberapa pelajar di Indonesia agar bisa kuliah di luar negeri. Di Indonesia sendiri pun ada berbagai macam beasiswa yang bisa membantumu kuliah di luar negeri. Beasiswa yang ada tersebut diberikan baik oleh pemerintah, lembaga, atau bahkan universitas tujuanmu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cara Kuliah di Luar Negeri: <strong>Beasiswa Pemerintah</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cara kuliah di luar negeri dengan beasiswa pemerintah adalah salah satu cara yang paling sering dicari oleh pelajar di Indonesia. Beasiswa tersebut diberikan dari pemerintah Indonesia atau pemerintah tempat tujuan studimu.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salah satu beasiswa pemerintah Indonesia yang paling banyak dikenal oleh pelajar Indonesia adalah LPDP. Beasiswa ini mencakup tiket pulang-pergi, biaya kuliah dan biaya hidup. Sebagai tambahan, LPDP juga mempunyai beberapa jenis beasiswa. Ada beasiswa untuk S1 dan juga untuk S2.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beberapa hal yang perlu dicatat adalah hampir semua beasiswa pemerintah membutuhkan sertifikat TOEFL/IELTS. Di sisi lain juga, LPDP mengharuskanmu untuk kembali ke Indonesia setelah masa studimu selesai. Yang artinya juga kamu harus siap melayani bangsamu setelah kamu selesai berkuliah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Beasiswa Universitas</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yang kedua adalah beasiswa universitas. Untuk bisa menerima beasiswa ini, kamu perlu diterima terlebih dahulu oleh universitas tujuanmu tersebut. Hal ini karena kamu perlu menunjukan performa akademis dan prestasi belajar yang bagus sebelum akhirnya pihak universitas akan memberikan beasiswa tersebut kepadamu.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beasiswa dari universitas ini bisa mencakup potongan uang kuliah penuh atau sebagian. Bahkan ada juga yang menanggung tempat tinggalmu di lingkungan kampus, uang makan, bahkan hingga uang transportasi. Tujuannya selain untuk menciptakan generasi yang lebih cemerlang adalah untuk mempererat kerja sama antara kedua negara di bidang pendidikan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cara Kuliah di Luar Negeri: <strong>Beasiswa Swasta</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Di sisi lain ada juga beasiswa dari swasta atau sponsor. Beberapa perusahaan biasanya juga membuka beasiswa untuk beberapa pelajar berprestasi untuk melanjutkan studi mereka di universitas dalam negeri maupun luar neger. Beasiswa sponsor ini biasanya akan juga mendatangkan kelebihan untuk karir kamu lho. Sebagai alumni penerima beasiswa, kemungkinan untuk diterima di perusahaan itu juga akan meningkat. Maka dari itu, kamu harus rajin-rajin juga untuk memeriksa beberapa situs perusahaan yang memberikan beasiswa ini. Perusahaan-perusahaan tersebut adalah mercedes, mitsubishi, dan beberapa perusahaan lainnya.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Beasiswa Kebudayaan</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jika kamu memiliki bakat khusus di bidang kesenian atau olahraga, kamu bisa mendapatkan beasiswa kebudayaan yang biasanya diberikan dalam bentuk residency, atau tinggal selama beberapa bulan di universitas atau galeri seni. Tujuan dari beasiswa ini adalah untuk menjalin hubungan antar budaya dari kedua negara.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beasiswa manapun yang kamu pilih tentunya bisa membantumu menggapai mimpimu untuk melanjutkan studimu di luar negeri. Pastikan kamu telah mempersiapkan semuanya dengan baik dan matang agar kamu bisa mendapatkan beasiswa yang kamu inginkan!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ingin dapat beasiswa di universitas top dunia?

Perlu kamu tahu bahwa untuk bisa kuliah di luar negeri, kamu perlu memenuhi beberapa persyaratan atau menyediakan beberapa dokumen yang bisa menyokong proses aplikasimu untuk bisa masuk universitas top di luar negeri. Penasaran ada apa saja? Simak artikel di bawah ini untuk cari tahu beberapa syarat kuliah di luar negeri.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Berbeda dengan perguruan tinggi di dalam negeri, perguruan tinggi di luar negeri memerlukan beberapa dokumen yang harus kamu penuhi. Berikut adalah beberapa dokumen dan syarat yang wajib kamu penuh:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Syarat Kuliah di Luar Negeri: <strong>Paspor</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Paspor adalah dokumen resmi yang dikeluarkan oleh pihak berwenang dari suatu negara yang memuat identitas sang pemegang dan berlaku untuk melakukan perjalanan antar negara. Ketika kamu akan masuk ke negara lain, kamu wajib untuk menunjukan paspormu. Maka dari itu, paspor merupakan syarat penting untuk kamu yang ingin melanjutkan studimu di luar negeri.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Proses pembuatan paspor ini juga bisa dibilang cukup mudah lho. Kamu hanya tinggal datang ke kantor imigrasi terdekat dan menyiapkan semua berkas yang diperlukan. Mudah bukan?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Visa</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Visa adalah ijin untuk berkunjung ke suatu negaera yang diberikan oleh sebuah kedutaan besar untuk orang yang ingin berkunjung ke sana. Walaupun kamu punya paspor, kamu tidak akan bisa masuk ke negara lain tanpa adanya ijin ini. Masuk ke negara lain tanpa menggunkana visa akan membuatmu menjadi imigran gelap di negara tersebut. Bentuk visa pun beragam, mulai dari stempel hingga cap tinta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visa yang kamu butuhkan untuk melanjutkan studi tentu saja berbeda dengan visa untuk berkunjung atau liburan. Biasanya visa untuk berkunjung hanya mencakup beberapa hari saja, tetapi visa untuk pelajar akan menyesuakian dengan masa studimu di sana. Untuk lebih mudah memproses visa pelajarmu, kamu cukup perlihatkan surat tanda kamu diterima di universitas tujuanmu itu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Sertifikat Kemampuan Bahasa Asing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Syarat kuliah di luar negeri yang satu ini juga sangat penting untuk keberlangsungan masa studimu di sana. Pasalnya, kamu akan menjalankan proses belajar mengajar di sana menggunakan bahasa umum yang digunakan negara tujuanmu. Maka dari itu, kamu perlu untuk lulus tes bahasa yang diwajibkan di beberapa negara.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salah satu contohnya adalah TOEFL dan IELTS. Tes ini mengetahui kapasitas kompetensi Bahasa Inggris yang kamu miliki untuk melanjutkan studimu. Salah satu negara yang mewajibkan kamu ikut tes ini adalah Amerika Serikat, Inggris, dan Singapura. Namun di negara lain pun ada tes bahasa juga.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Di Jepang ada tes bahasa bernama Japanese-Language Proficiency Test (JLPT). JLPT dibagi menjadi 5 level dari yang paling mudah N5 hingga yang paling sulit yaitu N1. Agar bisa terkualifikasi untuk bisa mlanjutkan masa studimu di sana, kamu perlu setidaknya lulus di level N2.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Syarat Kuliah di Luar Negeri: <strong>Surat Rekomendasi</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dokumen yang satu ini tentunya tidak boleh kamu lewatkan ya! Surat rekomendasi adalah salah satu syarat penting jika kamu ingin kuliah di luar negeri. Hal ini karena surat rekomendasi merupakan penilaian objektif yang diberikan oleh guru atau atasan kamu saat magang yang bisa menggambarkan kelebihan diri kamu. Surat rekomendasi biasanya diperlukan saat masa pendaftaran universitas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hal ini tentunya akan membuatmu terlihat lebih baik dan mencolok dibanding kandidat yang lain. Dengan begitu, kemungkinan kamu bisa diterima akan menjadi lebih tinggi juga lho!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cukup banyak kan syarat kuliah di luar negeri yang perlu kamu persiapkan? Beberapa negara dan universitas tentunya mempunyai syarat-syarat khusus mereka sendiri ya. Tapi, semua syarat di atas merupakan syarat umum yang bisa kamu persiapkan jauh-jauh hari sebelum masa pendaftaran tiba.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apa kamu tertarik untuk kuliah di luar negeri?

Banyak sekali perbedaan fasilitas dan harga yang jauh lebih mahal di luar. Maka dari itu, sebelum kamu berangkat ke sana atau membulatkan tekadmu untuk kuliah di luar negeri, kamu harus sudah tau biaya apa saja yang akan kamu keluarkan di sana.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Biaya Kuliah di Luar Negeri: <strong>Akomodasi</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Akomodasi tentunya merupakan sesuatu yang penting selama kamu berkuliah di sana. Ada beberapa pilihan yang bisa kamu pilih sebagai tempat akomodasi di sana. Hal ini tentu saja karena kamu adalah seorang pelajar yang sedang merantau. Maka dari itu, moda akomodasi yang kamu pilih tentunya harus nyaman untukmu. Pilihannya adalah asrama kampus, apartemen, dan homestay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asrama kampus bisa kamu jadikan sebagai pilihan utamamu sebagai akomodasi. Hal ini karena ada banyak kelebihan yang bisa kamu dapatkan ketika kamu tinggal di asrama kampus. Salah satunya adalah kamu akan tinggal di lingkungan kampus. Dengan begitu, kamu akan menghemat biaya transportasi dan bisa mengakses fasilitas kampus seperti perpustakaan, lab komputer, dan gym dengan lebih mudah. Asrama juga akan membuatmu lebih mudah untuk membuat koneksi karena kamu juga akan disatukan dengan pelajar internasional lainnya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asrama kampus juga ada 2 jenis yaitu catering <em>(catered)</em> atau tanpa layanan katering (<em>self catered</em>). Selain itu juga terdapat beberapa pilihan kamar. Mulai dari kamar single, sharing, dengan kamar mandi (<em>ensuite</em>) atau kamar mandi sharing. Di sisi lain, dengan tinggal di dalam asrama, kamu tidak perlu memikirkan biaya-biaya lainnya seperti listrik, air, dan perawatan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Selain asrama, kamu bisa menyewa apartemen pribadi. Apartemen biasanya berisikan 2 - 3 kamar. Moda akomodasi yang satu ini sangat cocok untuk kamu yang mempunyai teman-teman yang ingin kamu ajak tinggal bersama. Memilih untuk tinggal di apartemen berarti kamu siap untuk membayar listrik dan air secara pribadi. Selain itu kamu juga perlu mempertimbankan untuk memasak sendiri.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salah satu kelebihan tinggal di apartemen adalah kamu bisa mengenal kebudayaan lokal dan juga bisa lebih dekat dengan warga lokal. Dengan begitu, kamu bisa lebih tinggal di dalam komunitas yang ada di sekitar tempat tinggalmu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Biaya Kuliah di Luar Negeri: <strong>Makanan</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Biaya ini merupakan salah satu biaya utama yang harus kamu pikirkan dengan baik. Makan di restoran atau tempat makan akan jauh lebih besar dibanding kamu harus memasak sendiri.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sebagai seorang pelajar, tentunya akan lebih hemat jika kamu memasak sendiri. Dengan memasak sendiri, biaya yang kamu perhitungkan hanyalah biaya bahan-bahan masaknya dan belanja bulanan. Tapi tidak masalah jika kamu sekali-kali keluar untuk merasakan hidangan autentik di negara tujuanmu itu. Jika kamu tinggal dengan teman-temanmu, kamu juga bisa lebih menghemat pengeluaran dengan patungan uang belanja bulanan per bulan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Transport</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sebagai seorang pelajar yang aktif, biaya yang perlu kamu perhitungkan adalah biaya transportasi. Sebagai mahasiswa kamu pasti akan punya waktu untuk menjelajahi negara tempat kamu belajar tersebut. Tentu saja ini tergantung moda akomodasi yang kamu pilih. Semakin dekat tempat tinggalmu, tentu saja akan semakin rendah pengeluaranmu.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moda transportasi yang bisa kamu pilih sangat beragam mulai dari taksi, bis, hingga kereta bawah tanah. Untuk lebih menghemat pengeluaran, kamu bisa menggunakan kartu transportasi publik yang biasanya akan kamu bayar per bulan. Kamu juga akan mendapatkan potongan harga khusus pelajar yang bisa semakin menekan pengeluaran.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Memang cukup banyak biaya yang akan kamu keluarkan ketika kuliah di luar negeri. Hal ini tentunya bisa kamu minimalisir dengan beasiswa yang biasanya diberikan oleh pemerintah atau universitas tempatmu menimba ilmu. Selain itu, kamu juga bisa magang atau bekerja part-time untuk menambah uang jajanmu di sana.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tertarik untuk kuliah di luar negeri?

To put this figure in context, the UK accounts for around 80% of undergraduates and 36% of graduate students. Oxford is highly competitive, but not quite as rigorous as Harvard, Columbia, or Yale, which all have acceptance rates of roughly 5%. Oxford\'s admission percentage, on the other hand, is slightly lower than Cambridge\'s (21%). Despite this, both Oxford and Cambridge get upwards of 20,000 undergraduate applications per year from both within the United Kingdom and internationally.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How do you apply to the University of Oxford?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The application process in the UK is a little bit different compared to the US. This is due to all the universities in the UK using one system called the UCAS to handle the applications.

However, if you believe there is a need to be filled, you can form your own student society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 83 University sports clubs in Oxford, as well as other college teams and recreational activities. Many colleges have their own pitches and facilities, but Oxford University Sport on Iffley Road has a pool, gym, sports hall, racket sport courts, and other amenities. It also houses the running track where Roger Bannister set the four-minute mile record.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being an outstanding university, the University of Oxford has its own history and traditions that have been continued for centuries.

(11254, 'all-about-the-university-of-oxford', 1, 0, 'All About The University of Oxford', '<p>According to the QS World University Ranking 2022, the University of Oxford is placed number 2 in the world. Furthermore, as one of the most prestigious universities in the world, Oxford will provide you with a lot of opportunities to maximize your potential. Curious? Therefore, let\'s find out all the aspects below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The University of Oxford is an English higher education institution located in Oxford, Oxfordshire, England, and is one of the world\'s major universities. Moreover, it is located 50 miles (80 kilometers) north-northwest of London, along the upper course of the River Thames (dubbed the Isis by Oxford students).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oxford had schools by the early 12th century, according to a smattering of evidence. By the end of the century, the university had grown to prominence, possibly as a result of the expulsion of English students from the University of Paris in 1167. Furthermore, with original faculties of theology, law, medicine, and the liberal arts, Oxford was modeled after the University of Paris.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/top-university-of-oxford-majors-in-2022/\">Top Majors at the University of Oxford</a></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>University of Oxford has a lot of popular majors. Also, these majors are placed in the top 10 of the best in the world according to USnews. Here is the list of the top majors at the University of Oxford:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Philosophy and Theology</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Philosophy develops analytical rigor as well as the ability to critically evaluate and reason logically. It enables you to apply these skills to a wide range of contemporary and historical schools of thought and individual thinkers, as well as to questions ranging from how we acquire knowledge and make moral judgments to central questions in religious philosophy, such as the existence and nature of God, and the relevance of religion to human life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Modern Languages</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern Languages provides both practical training in written and spoken language as well as a thorough introduction to European literature and thinking. You can study a wide range of literature or focus your studies on any time from the medieval to the current day, in addition to learning to write and speak the language(s) fluently. Other courses such as linguistics, philology, film, or gender studies, as well as advanced translation (in French and German) are available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Geography</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Geography is an interdisciplinary degree that combines the natural and social sciences. Furthermore, this enhances a wide range of transferable skills and provides an education that covers important concerns on a variety of scales, from local to global. Moreover, there are a lot of themes that you can learn like climate and environmental change, inequality, social, economic, and cultural transition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/top-university-of-oxford-majors-in-2022/\">Curious about the other top majors in the world?

Furthermore, to put this figure in context, the UK accounts for around 80% of undergraduates and 36% of graduate students. Oxford is highly competitive, but not quite as rigorous as Harvard, Columbia, or Yale, which all have acceptance rates of roughly 5%. Oxford\'s admission percentage, on the other hand, is slightly lower than Cambridge\'s (21%). Despite this, both Oxford and Cambridge get upwards of 20,000 undergraduate applications per year from both within the United Kingdom and internationally.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How do you apply to the University of Oxford?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The application process in the UK is a little bit different compared to the US. This is due to all universities in the UK using one system called the UCAS to handle the applications. Moreover, UCAS is the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service which acts as an application portal for students from around the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are the deadlines for the University of Oxford application process.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Application Timeline</strong></td><td><strong>Dates</strong></td></tr><tr><td>UCAS Application</td><td>June - October</td></tr><tr><td>Test</td><td>November 2022</td></tr><tr><td>Written Work Submission (If needed)</td><td>October - November 2022</td></tr><tr><td>Interview</td><td>November 2022</td></tr><tr><td>Decision</td><td>January Next Year</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/breaking-down-university-of-oxford-acceptance-rate/\">Want to find out more about other aspects of the University of Oxford?

(11306, 'corporate-lawyer-facts-you-need-to-know', 7, 0, 'Corporate Lawyer: Facts You Need to Know', '<p>There has always been a general misunderstanding about what corporate lawyers actually do, with many people mistakenly thinking that the job entails having an overload of responsibility. It\'s common to hear that these lawyers typically work for corporations or big businesses. Some even think that they only handle issues regarding securities law but this is simply not true. But if you\'re looking to become a corporate lawyer, here are the things you should know.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is a corporate lawyer?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A corporate lawyer\'s job is to advise clients on their legal rights, responsibilities, and obligations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a corporation hires a corporate <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/get-to-know-all-kinds-of-lawyer/\">lawyer</a>, the lawyer represents the corporation itself rather than its shareholders or employees. This may be a difficult notion to grasp until you realize that a business is treated similarly to a person in the eyes of the law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A corporation is a legal body formed under state law with the primary aim of conducting business. A company is treated as a separate legal entity or \"person\" from its owners or shareholders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because businesses are subject to complicated state and federal regulations, corporate law encompasses all of the legal concerns that surround them. In the USA, most states require businesses to hold regular meetings, such as annual shareholder meetings. These meetings usually run with the presence of a corporate lawyer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What do you need to do to become a corporate lawyer?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The approach of becoming a corporate lawyer is similar to that of becoming a lawyer in another field. To practice law as a corporate lawyer, one must first complete law school and acquire a juris doctor (J.D.) degree. Furthermore, because these skills are largely depended upon in day-to-day business law practice, corporate lawyers should have exceptional writing, communication, and negotiation skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because corporate law is such a broad practice area that deals with a wide range of transnational, regulatory, and business-related issues. It\'s critical for a corporate lawyer to want to learn about a wide range of legal topics, unless they want to specialize in a niche area like securities law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, many corporate lawyers represent several clients in various industries, which necessitates a willingness to study the ins and outs of different industries. Finally, when they encounter a specialized area with which they are unfamiliar, such as tax, ERISA, employment, or real estate, corporate lawyers must have the self-awareness and resources to seek assistance from other lawyers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Job outlook in the future</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that the demand for corporate lawyers is increasing, albeit slowly. Between 2020 and 2030, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a 3% increase.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though lawyers most frequently work for law firms and the government, this is about to change. Many large corporations are attempting to minimize expenses by hiring in-house legal counsel rather than engaging a law firm, according to the BLS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other career paths you can pursue which are similar to a corporate lawyer:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Legal aid</li><li>Legal editor</li><li>Policy advisor</li><li>Policy analyst</li><li>Director of ethics</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a corporate lawyer is a career that serves as the interface between the business world and the legal system. To be a corporate lawyer, you need advanced education and licensing.

This is the fundamental legal principle in criminal law. This profession helps a lot of people achieve justice, or at least, prove that they are not guilty. If you are aiming to become one of the best criminal lawyers out there, then this article is perfect for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Criminal law establishes the definition of criminal offenses as well as the laws and procedures that apply. Criminal law prohibits all kinds of behavior that endangers the public\'s welfare and property. Therefore, This covers everything from murder, theft, and arson, to motor crime, money laundering, and terrorism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The criminal justice system serves two purposes. The law is used to regulate citizens\' behavior, but it also assists people in understanding the consequences of their acts. This is because criminal law also deals with the punishment and rehabilitation of people who break the rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is a Criminal Lawyer?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the broad nature of the profession and the vastness of criminal law, there is no one blueprint detailing the job description for a Criminal <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/get-to-know-all-kinds-of-lawyer/\">Lawyer</a>. In the subject of criminal law, there are various different sorts of attorneys. These are:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Criminal Defense Attorney</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A Criminal Defense Attorney represents someone who is accused or charged with a crime in court, ensuring that their legal rights are protected and that they receive a fair trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Criminal Duty</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A Criminal Duty Solicitor is another form of Criminal Defense Lawyer. This profession represents those who are suspected or accused of committing crimes but do not have access to a lawyer, whether they are in police custody or not. They provide pro bono (free) services because the Legal Services Commission, the government agency that provides Legal Aid, pays them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither the courts nor the police force hires criminal duty solicitors. Criminal Duty Lawyers work for a group of Solicitors to ensure that they protect the accused\'s legal rights. A Duty Solicitor can help those who have been arrested or held at a police station, as well as accompany them to their initial court appearance. They can\'t aid if the accused already has a lawyer, is in court, or has been charged with a crime that doesn\'t carry a sentence of imprisonment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Criminal Prosecutor</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK has what is called a Crown Prosecutor or Prosecution Lawyer. A profession that is in charge of presenting the case against persons accused of a crime. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is a government department that employs them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A prosecutor\'s position differs from that of a defense attorney not just in terms of who they represent, but also in terms of whether or not to prosecute the accused and take the matter to court.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How do you become a Criminal Lawyer?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Criminal lawyers, like all lawyers, must first earn a bachelor\'s degree before pursuing a law degree. The two degrees usually take seven years to accomplish in total. Criminal defense lawyers must pass the bar test in the state where they plan to practice. In the USA, the National Board of Legal Specialty Certification awards board certification to some criminal lawyers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Criminal Lawyer Job Outlook</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As there are new criminal laws and more people are charging under state and federal laws, the demand for criminal defense attorneys will increase. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, job growth for all attorneys, including criminal attorneys, is growing 8% between 2016 and 2026, higher than other occupations and industries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other career paths in criminal law include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Parole/Probation Officer</li><li>Paralegal/Legal Assistant</li><li>Legislator</li><li>Youth Correctional Counselor</li><li>Criminal Profiler</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A job as a criminal lawyer is very promising. As the profession is broadly needed not only by people who do not understand the law but also by those people who need to clear their names of any criminal accusation.

This is partially true — lawyers do argue a lot. But there\'s more to being an attorney than just arguing. Here\'s a list of careers that you can pursue after becoming a lawyer. Let\'s start with the basics: what is a lawyer?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is a lawyer?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A lawyer is a person who has gone a lot of training and has a license to prepare, handle, and prosecute or defend a court case on behalf of another person, as well as provide legal advice on situations that do not require judicial action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lawyers are professionals who apply the law to specific situations. They gather facts and evidence by speaking with their clients and reviewing documents, then writing and filing pleadings in court. They present evidence, ask witnesses and debate legal and factual issues during the trial. If they don\'t win the case, often they can ask for a fresh trial or redress in an appellate court.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Law is applicable in a lot of ways, which means there are a lot of areas that require the presence of a lawyer. Here are some paths that you can choose as a lawyer:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/corporate-lawyer-facts-you-need-to-know/\">Corporate Lawyer</a></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A corporate lawyer\'s job is to advise clients on their legal rights, responsibilities, and obligations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a corporation hires a corporate lawyer, the lawyer represents the corporation itself rather than its shareholders or employees. This may be a difficult notion to grasp until you realize that a business is treated similarly to a person in the eyes of the law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A corporation is a legal body formed under state law with the primary aim of conducting business. A company is treated as a legal entity or \"person\" separate from its owners or shareholders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The approach of becoming a corporate lawyer is similar to that of becoming a lawyer in other fields. To practice law as a corporate lawyer, one must first complete law school and acquire a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree. Furthermore, corporate lawyers should have exceptional writing, communication, and negotiation skills because these talents are largely dependent upon in day-to-day business law practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/facts-and-outlook-of-criminal-lawyer/\">Criminal Lawyer</a></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the broad nature of the profession and the vastness of criminal law, there is no one blueprint detailing the job description for a criminal lawyer.

A lawyer can be a part of the judicial system, working for courts and judges, and many argue that the best job for a lawyer is working for the government. This would allow you to really reform the system, especially in terms of getting opinions from different areas in the government. It\'s important to know that law school can be extremely difficult and it will take a lot of time and hard work on your end just to get your degree. However, with the right support and enough determination, anything is possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you interested in becoming a lawyer?

Industri obat merupakan salah satu industri paling penting di bidang kesehatan. Ahli farmasi membantu dokter untuk menindaklanjuti diagnosa mereka terhadap pasien dengan obat. Obat inilah yang membantu kamu dan banyak orang lainnya untuk sembuh dari berbagai macam penyakit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kita juga bisa ambil contohnya selama masa pandemik ini. Di situasi segenting ini, farmasi mengambil peran yang cukup penting dalam penanggulan virus Covid-19. Para ahli di bidang farmasi bekerja sama untuk mencipatkan obat dan vaksin yang bisa membantu kita untuk kebal dan sembuh dari penyakit virus ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Menurut U.S. Bureau of Labor, profesi apoteker diproyeksikan tumbuh 6 persen dari 2016 hingga 2026, kira-kira secepat rata-rata untuk semua pekerjaan. Beberapa faktor mungkin berkontribusi terhadap peningkatan ini. Permintaan diproyeksikan meningkat untuk apoteker di berbagai bidang kesehatan, termasuk rumah sakit dan klinik.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Biaya Kuliah Jurusan Farmasi</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Berikut adalah biaya kuliah jurusan farmasi yang perlu kamu ketahui. Selain biaya UKT atau uang kuliah, kamu tentunya perlu memikirkan biaya lainnya. Hal ini karena selama kamu di sana, kamu juga punya pengeluaran di luar akademik seperti biaya hidup, tempat tinggal, dan transportasi. Kita ambil saja contoh biaya hidup kamu di jurusan farmasi di Jepang.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Biaya Kuliah Jurusan Farmasi</strong>: Akomodasi</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Akomodasi merupakan pengeluaran terbesar siswa selain biaya kuliah. Siswa internasional memiliki tiga pilihan:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Asrama milik universitas</li><li><em>Guest House</em></li><li>Penyewaan pribadi</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Berbagi tempat tinggal dengan teman menjadi sedikit lebih populer dalam beberapa tahun terakhir. Karena memang belum sepopuler di barat, hal ini membuat tempat asrama biasanya terbatas. Pada tahun 2015, sekitar 85% siswa menyewa secara pribadi. Survei menunjukkan bahwa rata-rata sewa bulanan untuk pelajar (termasuk biaya layanan) di Tokyo adalah sekitar ¥60,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Biaya Kuliah Jurusan Farmasi: <strong> Kuliah</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Untuk biaya kuliah di Jepang bervariasi untuk setiap perguruan tinggi. Universitas di Jepang termasuk dalam dua kategori utama: institusi publik, dan swasta (independen).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Berikut perkiraan rata-rata biaya kuliah di Jepang untuk program gelar sarjana (S1), master (S2) dan juga doktor (S3) per tahunnya untuk berbagai jurusan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td>Kualifikasi</td><td>Dalam JPY</td></tr><tr><td>S1</td><td>¥946,300 / Semester</td></tr><tr><td>S2 & S3</td><td>¥320.000 / Semester</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Biaya Transportasi</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Japan Rail East (JR East), sejauh ini merupakan operator jaringan kereta api terbesar di Jepang. Perusahaan menawarkan diskon 20% untuk tiket komuter yang juga berlaku di akhir pekan untuk perjalanan di dalam 23 Daerah Khusus Tokyo. Ini setara dengan biaya tiket kereta komuter 3 bulan yaitu sekitar ¥20,000 untuk pelajar. Tentu saja, semakin dekat kamu dengan universitas, biaya transportasi akan lebih murah, dan biaya rata-rata 1 bulan untuk siswa diperkirakan&nbsp; ¥5,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cukup banyak kan biaya kuliah jurusan farmasi yang harus kamu perhitungkan sebelum kamu berkuliah di luar negeri. Walaupun biaya ini bisa dibilang cukup mahal, tapi kamu perlu tahu juga kalau ada banyak cara yang bisa membantumu untuk kuliah di sana. Kamu bisa mendaftar beasiswa atau kerja part-time untuk menyokong hidupmu di sana.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Punya mimpi untuk masuk jurusan farmasi di luar negeri?

However, it\'s no secret that studying abroad can be very expensive.

Writing a <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/study-abroad-your-ultimate-guide-to-be-an-international-students/\">study abroad</a> essay can be really challenging, especially if this is your first time. But fret not, as we\'ll go over some tips on how to craft your study abroad essay!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is a study abroad essay?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A study abroad essay is usually part of the application process, where you\'ll talk about your goals, experiences, and reasons for wanting to study abroad. Furthermore, the essay helps university admission officers to gain a more holistic understanding of who the applicants are. From why you have chosen the university, and why the chosen program is the right fit for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #1: Brainstorm&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When applying to study abroad programs, you\'ll need to answer questions like ‘Tell me about yourself,\' or ‘Why do you want to study abroad?\'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While these questions may sound simple, it can be tricky to narrow down your ideas and summarize them in a way that fits into a 300- to 600-word response.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the ways to tackle these questions is to start by making a list of why you want to study abroad. This helps you get an idea of what your essay will cover. You can think about what you wish to gain from your experience of studying abroad. Not only that, but you can also think about your plans when studying there. If you find yourself confused as to your own motivations to study abroad, then it\'s a good time to start reflecting and thinking about your goals here rather than during the drafting process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #2: Show Your Personality</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to stand out in your essay is to be yourself. You always want to leave that lasting impression: who are you as a student, a person?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing that some universities have different essay prompts from others, it\'s best to know where you\'re applying to. Do your research about the different types of essays as well as what each university wants from you. In this way, you can make sure your essay is a good fit for the school you\'re applying to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To add a personal touch to your essay, try adding a personal story that resonates with your study abroad plan. Remember, your essay should be a reflection of who you are as a person, not as an applicant or a student. Moreover, you want the admission officer to feel like they know who you are as a person. Even if they\'ve never met you before.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #3: Don\'t forget to proofread&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Never hit submit without first proofreading your essay! You might pick up on typos or awkward sentences that need to be fixed at a second glance. During the course of proofreading your essay, you might think of a new idea or way to structure it—it wouldn\'t hurt to try using these new ideas and see if they improve the essay. Also, a little extra time can go a long way toward helping you avoid common issues like spelling errors and sentence structure problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s also always a good idea to have someone else look at your essay, as you might get some feedback on your writing and gain perspective on what worked and what didn\'t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s no doubt that applying to study abroad is a long and complicated process. But all the challenges you face right now are nothing compared to the rewards you\'ll receive for tackling them successfully!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s never too early to begin the search for scholarships. Little did you know, scholarship doesn\'t only give you a cost benefit, but also could help you for your future prospects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Download “University Preparation Guidebook: Scholarship Edition” Guidebook to find out all the things you need to know before applying for scholarships.

Undoubtedly, the entire process can be a long and pretty tricky one. You may feel overwhelmed trying to figure it out. Lucky for you, we\'ll go over the things you need to know about studying abroad. Also, this includes why you should do it, its benefits, the best countries to study abroad, and even scholarships you can get. Let\'s dive right into your study abroad guide!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why study abroad?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First things first, why bother studying abroad? Well, studying abroad is a life-changing experience for a variety of reasons. You may consider these:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Stand out to future employers - While studying abroad, you\'ll gain valuable skills that you may not be aware of, but employers will take note of! For instance, after years of dealing with a range of new situations on your own, you\'ll grow into a stronger and better communicator. Or when you\'re dealing with multiple languages, you\'ll gain the ability to be multilingual, which will put you at an advantage, especially at a multinational company!</li><li>Expand your network - Whether you\'re meeting someone from your country or making friends with a local, it\'s never a bad idea to build your connections. From making lifelong friendships to becoming business partners, the potential of expanding your network is limitless!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about the life-altering reasons why you should study abroad, find out here!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best countries to study abroad</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing the right destination is crucial to getting the most out of your study abroad. With hundreds of countries, cities, and towns to choose from, you won\'t be short of choices. In fact, you might feel overwhelmed by the large number of destinations to choose from.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help narrow down your search, try asking yourself some of these questions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Do I want to study in a country where English isn\'t the first language?</li><li>Do I want to study in a country that\'s close to my home country?</li><li>Which country suits my financial budget best?</li><li>Do I want to live in a quiet town or in a big city?</li><li>Do I want to stay in the country after I graduate?&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ideal Study Destination</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from asking yourself some of the aforementioned questions, try to pick out two or three ideal study destinations that strike your interest. After that, you can start comparing the pros and cons. Some of the factors you can consider when compiling the pros and cons include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Climate - Which one seems ideal for you? A colder or a warmer climate?</li><li>Student life - Check out the student activities, university societies, and transport systems.</li><li>Culture - Figure out the residents\' attitude towards international students or visitors from other parts of the world.</li><li>Programs offered - See what you\'ll study and how. Some degrees focus more on theory, while others on practice. Take note of the duration of the studies.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, you can also ask friends, families, and others who already study abroad. Moreover, sitting down and chatting with someone about their experiences traveling and studying abroad can help you understand what to expect, the challenges, and even some tips. Chances are, they might give you insightful information you can\'t get anywhere else!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, if you\'re still not sure which countries are the best to study abroad, here are some of the best countries to study abroad:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Singapore - Known for its rapid economic development, Singapore also boasts itself as a highly competitive country in terms of academics. Furthermore, from its stellar reputation in students\' safety to its universities that rub shoulders with the world\'s top universities, Singapore can be on top of your list!</li><li>USA - Home to the well-known Ivy League institutions, the US offers a lot of things, including academic excellence, a diverse environment, and a flexible education system.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Head over here to explore more about some of the best countries to study abroad!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Benefits of studying abroad</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many have said it before—studying abroad is not all about academics. Here are some of the benefits you can get while studying abroad:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A step closer to adult life - Whether you\'re living with some of your closest friends, or living all on your own, studying abroad pushes you to become independent and self-supporting. Also, even in the most stressful moments of maintaining your grades, keeping your room clean, and managing your finances, you\'ll learn to rise and find out what you\'re truly made of.</li><li>Travel, travel, and travel - Whether it\'s a weekend trip to the nearest city or a day trip to the beach, you\'ll expose yourself to new things you wouldn\'t be able to experience at home. In some cases, you may even get the chance to tick off some of your bucket lists!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out even more benefits you can get while you\'re studying abroad here!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Study Abroad with Scholarships</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tuition fees and living costs can quickly add up to a large budget for your education. Fortunately, scholarships can serve as your financial support! Here are some of the attractive scholarships you can get:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>National University of Singapore - ASEAN Undergraduate Scholarship<ul><li>Award amount: Tuition fees (after MOE Tuition Grant Subsidy), S$5,800 annual living allowance</li></ul></li><li>University of Minnesota - Global Excellence Scholarship<ul><li>Award amount: up to USD 25,000 per year for up to 4 years</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For further insight into what scholarships are offered, click here!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/how-to-study-abroad-for-free-a-complete-guide/\">How to Study Abroad for Free</a></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although studying abroad has its great advantages, it isn\'t exactly affordable. In order to study abroad, you will need to pay for both your tuition fees and other necessary items, such as housing, food, health insurance, etc. The cost of studying abroad drastically adds up when you take all of these things into account. However, there are multiple ways for you to study abroad for free.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incredibly expensive tuition fees make studying abroad a bit difficult, so here are some of the ways you can study abroad for free:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Seek out financial aid.</strong> Apply to the Indonesia Endowment Funds for Education (LPDP) which is offered to students by the Indonesian Ministry of Finance.</li><li><strong>Check out university scholarships</strong>. Apply by submitting your academic transcript, personal statement, and letters of recommendation.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Earn while you learn</strong>. Learn for cheaper by working a part-time job along with your studies to take off some of the financial burdens of studying abroad.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, not everyone can receive funds or apply for university scholarships. In order to receive the rewards from either the Indonesia Endowment Funds for Education (LPDP) or from university scholarships, you need to meet their standards. Whether it be scoring a certain number on a test, or maintaining a minimum GPA, not everyone can get access to the rewards from these benefactors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that being said, these are some of the best methods that you can try in order to study abroad for free. Seeking out funds from the Indonesia Endowment Funds for Education (LPDP), applying for university scholarships, and the “earn while you learn” method are all ways that can help you combat the expensive tuition given by universities abroad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color\"><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/how-to-study-abroad-for-free-a-complete-guide/\">Want to know more about how you can study abroad for free?

Pasalnya, ilmu yang telah kamu pelajari bukan merupakan ilmu umum, melainkan ilmu khusus yang hanya bisa kamu dapatkan di bangku universitas saja. Di Indonesia sendiri, perusahaan tambang sangat banyak. Tidak hanya dari negara kita saja alias BUMN, melainkan banyak perusahaan dari luar negeri yang juga aktif di Indonesia. Kamu juga bisa mempunyai kesempatan untuk bekerja <em>offshore </em>atau di kantor pusat perusahaan-perusahaan internasional. Di sisi lain, kamu bisa dengan mudah mendapatkan portofolio yang bagus ketika sudah bekerja di pertambangan.

Lapangan kerja yang dimiliki oleh lulusan jurusan pertambangan merupakan salah satu yang akan selalu ada. Industri pertambangan merupakan salah satu industri yang paling penting di dunia. Hal ini karena pertambangan merupakan salah satu industri yang banyak memasok bahan baku untuk bahan bakar. Selain itu, industri ini juga merupakan salah satu tahapan awal dari proses produksi suatu barang. Contohnya batu baterai yang dipakai oleh mobil listrik yang sedang terkenal saat ini. Pembuatan bahan bakarnya memerlukan bahan baku nikel yang hanya bisa diperoleh dari pertambangan nikel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Terlebih lagi, industri pertambangan merupakan industri vital bagi perekonomian suatu negara. Contoh lah Indonesia yang tengah melakukan ekspor bahan baku besar-besaran keluar negeri. Setelah lulus dari kuliah jurusan pertambangan, kamu akan berperan serta untuk meningkatkan dan menjaga tingkat ekspor pertambangan Indonesia lho.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cukup banyak kan alasan untuk memilih kuliah jurusan pertambangan?

Di dalam proses pertambangan ini, ada tiga tahap yang akan kamu lalui yaitu: eksplorasi, eksploitasi, dan pemrosesan. Eksplorasi adalah proses pencarian mineral berharga. Eksploitasi merupakan proses penambangan mineral tersebut.

Kamu juga bisa mempunyai kesempatan untuk bekerja <em>offshore </em>atau di kantor pusat perusahaan-perusahaan internasional.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Sering Melakukan Kunjungan Lapangan</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bagi kamu yang tidak mau hanya bekerja di balik meja atau pun di luar ruangan, jurusan ini sangat cocok untukmu.

Ini Daftar Jurusan Arsitektur Kerja Apa di Masa Depan', '<p>Jurusan arsitek tentu pastinya akan mengantarmu untuk berkarir di bidang arsitektur, tapi apa hanya itu saja? Tentu saja tidak! <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/id/kupas-tuntas-semua-fakta-tentang-jurusan-arsitektur/\">Jurusan arsitektur</a> bisa mengantarmu ke jenjang karir yang cukup banyak dan cukup tinggi. Ingin tahu jurusan arsitektur kerja apa di masa depan?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ayo simak di bawah ini!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Arsitek</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prospek karir yang satu ini cukup jelas untuk kamu yang ingin masuk ke jurusan arsitektur. Yup, Arsitek menjadi profesi yang paling banyak diminati oleh para mahasiswa jurusan arsitektur karena sangat berkaitan dengan mendesain dan membuat bangunan. Tugas dari seorang arsitek yaitu membuat desain atau <em>blueprint</em> bangunan, lalu disesuaikan dengan permintaan klien. Jadi, sebuah proyek bisa berjalan dengan baik ketika si arsitek ini mampu mengkombinasikan idenya dengan ide klien.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Drafter</strong>; Contoh Jurusan Arsitektur Kerja Apa</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Profesi yang satu ini merupakan salah satu penopang arsitek. Pada umumnya arsitek hanya memberikan desain kasar kepada klien. Sementara untuk sebuah desain yang lebih detail dan menyeluruh biasanya akan dipercayakan ke tangan drafter. Profesi ini akan sangat dibutuhkan baik dari sisi klien maupun sisi pengembang. Hal ini karena biasanya ada beberapa pengembang yang memakai arsitek dari luar, dengan begitu hasilnya bisa ditindaklanjuti oleh sebuah perusahaan pengembang tersebut.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Kontraktor</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kalau berbicara soal jurusan arsitektur bisa kerja apa, kontraktor adalah salah satunya. Perlu dicatat bahwa kontraktor itu jauh berbeda dengan arsitek. Hal ini karena kewajiban seorang kontraktor adalah memimpin dan mengarahkan sebuah proyek pembangunan supaya selaras dengan waktu, kualitas, dan biaya yang sudah ditetapkan oleh klien. Jadi, cukup atau tidaknya biaya pembangunan itu diatur dan tergantung kepada keahlian seorang kontraktor dalam mengelola anggaran.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Developer</strong>; Contoh Jurusan Arsitektur Kerja Apa</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apa kamu tahu perusahaan seperti Sinarmas Land, Agung Podomoro, atau Lippo Karawaci? Perusahaan tersebut merupakan perusahaan pengembang properti atau biasa dikenal dengan Developer. Developer ini merupakan jenjang karir yang paling pas untuk kamu yang hobi membangun perumahan, mengembangkan sebuah lahan, dan menjadikannya sebagai ladang bisnis. Namun modalnya bukanlah milik pribadi, melainkan digunakan dari pihak ketiga. Hal ini karena biaya yang diperlukan untuk mengembangkan sebuah tanah atau properti bisa mencapai triliunan rupiah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Surveyor</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ketika kamu membangun suatu proyek atau rumah, semua faktor yang ada harus berdasarkan peraturan yang sudah ditetapkan. Hal ini meliputi luas, bentuk tanah, hingga posisi bangunannya. Di sinilah peran surveyor dibutuhkan. Kewajiban seorang surveyor adalah memastikan apakah pengukuran suatu proyek atau bangunan dilakukan secara tepat atau malah menyeleweng. Karena erat kaitannya dengan pengukuran, seorang surveyor harus menguasai ilmu matematika yang baik. Jangan sampai hasil bangunannya di luar ekspektasi, apalagi sampai tidak sesuai ukuran.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Konsultan Arsitektur</strong>; Contoh Jurusan Arsitektur Kerja Apa</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ketika kamu sudah berhasil mengurus banyak proyek dan jam terbangmu sudah tinggi, di saat itulah kamu bisa melanjutkan karirmu menjadi seorang konsultan arsitektur. Biasanya profesi ini kurang direkomendasi untuk mahasiswa yang baru saja lulus fresh graduate karena baru akan memulai karier. Sebab, profesi ini hanya cocok untuk orang-orang yang sudah mempunyai pengalaman kerja yang cukup lama. Hal ini karena tuntutan pekerjaan yang berat dan memerlukan tanggung jawab yang tinggi.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Dosen</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kalau kamu tipe orang yang kurang suka untuk turun ke lapangan, profesi ini sangat cocok untukmu. Kamu akan tetap berkutat di bidang ilmu pengetahuan, terutama untuk menurunkan ilmu yang sudah kamu dapat ke generasi baru. Hingga saat ini, masih sangat banyak universitas yang memerlukan dosen untuk menghasilkan arsitek yang mempunyai kualitas terbaik.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apa kamu tertarik menjadi salah satu dari profesi di atas? Ingat ya! Profesi di atas memerlukan ketekunan dan passion di bidang arsitektur. Selain itu, untuk bisa bersaing di kelas dunia, kamu juga perlu untuk masuk ke universitas terbaik juga.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Download Panduan “University Preparation Guidebook: Scholarship Edition” untuk mencari tahu semua hal yang perlu kamu ketahui sebelum mendaftar beasiswa.

If you\'re still not sure about what mentors and mentoring are all about, don\'t worry! In this article, we\'ll learn more about mentoring programs for youth, particularly those between 13 and 18 years old, their purposes, and what you\'ll gain from them. Let\'s dive into it!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is a mentoring program?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/mentoring-programs-these-are-all-reasons-why-you-need-it/\">Mentoring programs</a> for youth connect adults with expertise in a certain area to youths who are interested in that area and need guidance to pursue their interests</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who has “been there, done that”, a mentor can share practical and helpful advice, offer guidance, and act as a sounding board for your thoughts. In a way, mentoring programs for youth help break down any barriers you have, such as not knowing what to pursue after high school or how to pursue it, to create opportunities for success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Role of the Mentor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentoring programs for youth connect teenagers to adults with expertise in a certain area who are able to provide guidance and encouragement throughout the mentee\'s years in school. Moreover, these programs can range from limited guidance for school and academics only, to help with interest exploration and future career goals, to things like navigating friendships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of going through blind trial and error in your learning process, a mentor is someone who can help direct your learning to make it more effective.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A mentor\'s role is multifaceted, it depends on what kind of mentor you are seeking. A mentor can be:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>a role model</li><li>a supporter&nbsp;</li><li>a coach&nbsp;</li><li>an advisor</li><li>a friend</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Types of Mentoring&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentoring programs can help you in several areas. Here are some examples:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Education</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you find it hard to grasp some concepts at school. With mentor, you can gain a better understanding of real-world applications from someone who is an expert in their field. Furthermore, this would complement your learning in school, helping grow your understanding and possibly even your interest in studying that area.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Future Career Goals</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With numerous options out there, it may be hard to pick which field is best suited for you. Through a mentoring program, you are encouraged to explore your interests beyond just the school environment. In this way, you\'ll get to understand yourself more and make better-informed decisions for your future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Benefits of joining a mentoring program for youth&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Receive guidance&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentors give their mentees advice on how to approach certain situations or point out things that they may not have considered before. As mentors are people who are successful in their field, they can provide valuable insight into what it takes to succeed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Networking opportunities</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Through a mentoring program, a mentor can introduce their mentee to industry contacts that they might not have been able to connect with otherwise. Through this, mentees could land an internship or a part-time position to enhance their skills in their desired area.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Increased confidence</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentorship programs allow mentees to take ownership of their personal, academic, and professional development. Instead of feeling stagnant, having a mentor can accelerate a mentee\'s growth by having a trustworthy figure to consult for advice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, the mentoring relationship is a relationship between two people who share a common interest and is mutually beneficial. The mentor is someone who has been down the path you\'re on. They can offer their perspective on what it takes to get there. They are there to help you develop your skills and knowledge, as well as provide you with encouragement and guidance through the ever-confusing world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Download “University Preparation Guidebook: Scholarship Edition” Guidebook to find out all the things you need to know before applying for scholarships.

Read on to find out what you can gain from joining a mentoring program and why it might be right for you!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is a mentor?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A mentor is someone who possesses expertise in the skills that the mentee would like to develop. They can help guide you in your progression as a student. Aside from providing direct feedback, mentors can also serve as a sounding board for your ideas and problems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentor-mentee relationships can take a variety of forms, depending on the mentor\'s availability and mentee\'s needs. The relationship could be short-term or continue indefinitely, with regular meetings or casual check-ins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, mentors provide guidance on how to achieve your goals, and they also help you identify your strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Different forms of mentoring programs&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Traditional mentoring</strong> is when a mentor and a mentee are matched one-on-one, either through a program or on their own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Group mentoring </strong>involves a mentor working with small groups of mentees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Team mentoring</strong> involves several mentors working together with a small group of mentees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>E-mentoring </strong>is a form of one-on-one mentoring that happens virtually through the Internet, email, social media, or other forms of internet communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why you should join mentoring programs for students</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning all the different concepts and theories in school is fascinating. But of course, it also comes with its challenges. Sometimes there are things that you find hard to understand, or maybe you have an idea for a project and want to discuss it with someone who would know how to help you with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing that mentors have gone through the same experience as you, means they know what it takes to succeed in school. By working with a mentor, you\'ll be guided to understand the concepts that you learned in school with real-world expectations and applications, which can be applied throughout your personal and professional lives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, a mentor can be your rock while you face the ups and downs of school.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Difference between mentors and tutors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A mentor is someone who can act as a role model, navigate your path, and help you with personal development. A tutor, on the other hand, has a more specific role in helping you learn the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key difference between a mentor and a tutor is that mentors offer more than just knowledge or technical assistance; they help their mentees develop skills that will help them succeed in their academic and life goals. Mentors also have more time to devote to their mentees than tutors do—tutors have a role solely in academic needs. They provide guidance and instruction to students when it comes down to studying for exams or completing assignments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guidance and skills. With that in mind, they can share industry knowledge you would not have access to otherwise. From the things they wish they had known to technical advice on any potential projects, mentors are there to help you reach your goals and succeed in the long run.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>See a different perspective</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, it can be hard to know what\'s best for you. When you\'re faced with a decision, it can be tough to know whether or not you\'re making the right choice. What if you could ask someone else\'s opinion?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s where mentors come in. A mentor is someone who can offer advice from a different perspective with an understanding of your goals and current situation. Through several discussions with your mentor, you\'ll be guided to see things from the bigger picture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you know the importance of joining mentoring programs for students. The benefits that a mentor-mentee relationship can provide for your academic, personal, and professional lives are ones you won\'t want to pass up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Download “University Preparation Guidebook: Scholarship Edition” Guidebook to find out all the things you need to know before applying for scholarships.

Numerous practical and emotional variables can influence whether a family decides to hire a college admissions adviser. Below you will find a lot of benefits that you can get from getting mentored by a university application consultant.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Relieve the College Application Stress</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No rational parent wants to hover over their stressed-out children for months on end, nagging them about their essays and exam results. On the other hand, the idea of handling every aspect of the challenging application process alone makes the majority of high school students shudder. School counseling centers meant to assist students are frequently overworked and underfunded, which adds fuel to the flame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a university application consultant, you can expect streamlined, facilitated, and effective communication. The very best college admissions counselors start by carefully studying both the student and the family. They are quite explicit about how often and in what format they will communicate with each party. They have reliable mechanisms in place to make sure that any hiccups in the process are discovered quickly and dealt with cooperatively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Develop an Admissions Strategy</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you heard that the acceptance rates to MIT and Harvard have gone up for the class of 2024? No high school student has the time to become an expert in admissions, but there are many stories and legends. You\'ve surely heard of the high school alumna who graduated sixth in her class but was accepted to MIT and Yale, or the youngster who attended Brown despite failing chemistry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>University Admission Consultants can help you strategize your university shortlisting by choosing a balanced selection of schools. You might have heard of “safety”, “reach”, and “target” schools. But how many do you choose, and how do you choose ones that will fit you best, no matter the category? Along with thoroughly reviewing your application, an admissions consultant will start a dialogue with you about your true educational goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Crafting the Right Story in Each Application</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a cohesive personal narrative has become more important as more universities abandon the standardized test and elite colleges lengthen and add additional essays. In many respects, knowing where you\'ve been and where you\'re going go hand in hand with creating a strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a university application consultant, you will have the opportunity to discuss and reflect on your profile and experiences and how best to represent them in an application. In order to show maturity and progress in the application, a college admissions consultant will guide you in finding out your motivations and goals. Your story should naturally crystallize over time by speaking openly about both the humorous and the serious topics. Whatever is on your mind, no matter how vague or embarrassing, you should feel free to discuss it with the university consultant. The better they know you, the better they\'re able to advise you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentoring programs and university consultants have their own role in helping you with your education and university applications. In order to achieve your dream, you must not do it alone. There are many people that can help you get to pursue your future educational and professional goals. You just need to look and ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Download “University Preparation Guidebook: Scholarship Edition” Guidebook to find out all the things you need to know before applying for scholarships.

Jangan khawatir! Kita bahas semuanya di sini. Jurusan Multimedia adalah salah satu jurusan yang sedang terkenal di kalangan anak muda saat ini. Hal ini juga dipengaruhi dengan berkembangnya dunia digital yang semakin hari semakin menjadi ketergantungan bagi setiap lini bisnis. Ayo simak di bawah ini beberapa career yang bisa kamu pilih sebagai lulusan jurusan multimedia!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Web Designer</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Web Designer membuat dan membangun situs web dan halaman web dengan menggabungkan sejumlah elemen desain visual termasuk teks, foto, grafik, animasi, dan video. Seorang Web Designer dapat membuat situs web baru atau sekadar memperbarui desain dan tata letak halaman yang ada.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web Designer tidak bertanggung jawab terutama untuk mengetahui cara kerja kode yang menopang desain mereka — tetapi alih-alih fokus mereka adalah menciptakan tampilan yang estetis dan pengguna memiliki pengalaman pengguna yang positif saat mereka mengunjungi situs web. Web Designer mungkin menggunakan bahasa pemrograman seperti HTML, CSS, dan JavaScript, akan menggunakan perangkat lunak desain grafis — termasuk produk seperti Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, dan GIMP — untuk membantu menciptakan desain yang menarik, dan mereka akan menguji desain mereka melalui pembuatan prototipe dan gambar rangka.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Jurusan Multimedia Kerja Apa? <strong>Animator</strong>!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Seorang animator menghasilkan beberapa gambar yang disebut <em>frame</em>, yang bila diurutkan dapat menciptakan ilusi gerakan, yang biasa juga dikenal sebagai animasi. Gambar dapat berupa gambar digital atau gambar tangan, model atau boneka.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Animator cenderung bekerja dalam 2D, pembuatan model 3D, stop-frame atau animasi yang dihasilkan komputer. Animasi yang dihasilkan komputer memiliki fitur yang kuat dalam film (untuk membuat efek khusus atau film animasi dengan sendirinya), serta dalam aspek televisi, internet, dan industri permainan komputer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keterampilan dasar animasi masih sangat bergantung pada kemampuan artistik, tetapi ada kebutuhan yang meningkat bagi animator untuk terbiasa dengan paket komputer teknis.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Jurusan Multimedia Kerja Apa?<strong>Illustrator</strong>!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ilustrator adalah seorang seniman yang menciptakan gambar dua dimensi untuk berbagai perusahaan dan industri, seperti desain fashion, buku anak-anak, majalah, manual medis, situs web, desain teknis, dan periklanan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ilustrasi dapat menyampaikan perasaan, makna, atau esensi terkadang lebih efektif daripada yang dapat dilakukan oleh dinding teks. Ilustrasi dapat menyederhanakan ide yang rumit, melengkapi kata atau pesan yang disampaikan kepada pengguna, dan terkadang berdiri sendiri tanpa penjelasan yang diperlukan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Penting bagi ilustrator untuk mendengarkan dan memahami kebutuhan klien, dan dapat bertukar ide dan mengerjakan ulang berbagai konsep hingga kedua belah pihak mencapai interpretasi dan ilustrasi akhir. Bakat alami, pendidikan, dan latihan terus menerus diperlukan untuk menjadi sukses sebagai ilustrator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ilustrasi telah menjadi karir yang sangat kompetitif. Hal ini berarti bahwa sebagian besar ilustrator mengembangkan estetika desain yang sangat berbeda sehingga karya mereka menonjol. Meskipun karya seorang ilustrator sangat kreatif, terkadang itu berarti bahwa mereka harus terus bekerja keras. Bahkan ketika mereka tidak merasa terinspirasi secara khusus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Interactive Media Designer</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Media interaktif adalah setiap elektronik yang merespon perintah manusia dengan cara yang spesifik dan jelas. Media interaktif tidak hanya mencakup video game, tetapi juga merupakan prinsip yang mendasari aplikasi pada ponsel pintar karena mereka bereaksi terhadap sentuhan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Periklanan modern telah mengimplementasikan<em> interactive media</em>. Kamu dapat mengunjungi berbagai situs web dan mengunggah fotomu sendiri untuk melihat seperti apa penampilan kamu dengan warna atau gaya rambut yang berbeda. Kamu juga akan menemukan situs web dengan media interaktif yang hebat. Media tersebut dirancang hanya untuk hiburan pribadi, seperti melihat penampilan kamu jika diubah menjadi <em>zombie</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ada banyak sekali pilihan karir yang bisa kamu pilih setelah kamu lulus dari jurusan multimedia. Jadi, kamu sudah tidak perlu ragu lagi untuk memilih jurusan ini sebagai jurusan pilihan kamu ya!

Kalau kamu sudah siap secara mental, ada beberapa hal yang harus kamu tahu jika kamu ingin kuliah di sana yaitu biaya kuliah. Biaya kuliah <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/id/jurusan-tata-boga-universitas-biaya-dan-persyaratan/\">jurusan tata boga</a> di Le Cordon Bleu tidaklah murah. Karena kamu tidak hanya mengurusi biaya per semesternya, melainkan juga biaya tinggalmu di sana. Ayo simak artikel ini lebih lanjut untuk mengetahui detail pengeluaran kamu selama berkuliah di Le Cordon Bleu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Alasan Memilih Jurusan Tata Boga</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Berkuliah di jurusan tata boga atau program seni kuliner akan memungkinkan kamu untuk mempelajari keterampilan dan pengetahuan yang diperlukan seorang koki di dapur, yang mencakup tidak hanya mengetahui cara memasak tetapi juga cara membuat hidangan baru, cara menjaga keamanan dapur, cara menjalankan dapur secara efisien dan masih banyak lagi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pelatihan seni kuliner dapat memberikan kamu keterampilan yang sangat dibutuhkan untuk membantu menyiapkan makanan dengan aman dan menyajikannya dalam waktu yang cepat serta cara yang menyenangkan secara visual. Ada berbagai peluang karir dalam jurusan tata boga. Jenjang karir berkisar dari anggota staf persiapan bahan makanan hingga kepala koki.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karir yang cemerlang juga memerlukan awal yang baik. Salah satunya adalah dengan mengambil jurusan tata boga di Le Cordon Bleu. Tapi, untuk berkuliah di sana tidaklah murah. Berikut beberapa rincian biaya yang akan kamu keluarkan selama menimba ilmu di sana.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Biaya Kuliah Jurusan Tata Boga</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Berikut adalah biaya kuliah jurusan tata boga yang perlu kamu ketahui. Selain biaya UKT atau uang kuliah, kamu tentunya perlu memikirkan biaya lainnya. Prancis adalah negara yang populer bagi siswa internasional, terutama karena biaya pendidikan yang rendah, dan karena budayanya terkenal di seluruh dunia. Walaupun biaya studi jauh lebih murah di Prancis dibandingkan dengan Amerika Serikat atau Inggris, kamu juga perlu tahu detailnya. Sekarang, mari kita lihat berapa berapa total biaya hidup berkuliah di Paris.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Biaya Akomodasi</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Untuk hidup dengan benar tanpa bantuan apa pun, kamu akan menghabiskan sekitar € 1,100 per bulan di Paris. Tetapi bisa lebih tergantung di mana kamu tinggal (di pusat atau di pinggiran kota) dan gaya hidupmu di sana.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pertama, biaya makan. Dalam sehari, kamu harus mengeluarkan biaya setidaknya € 7,50 untuk 2 kali makan. Itupun jika kamu makan di rumah makan yang disediakan oleh kampusmu sendiri. Tetapi jika kamu memilih untuk makan di tempat makan yang ada di luar kampus, kamu setidaknya harus menghabiskan € 15 untuk sekali makan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yang kedua tentu saja biaya tempat tinggalmu di sana. Untuk biaya yang satu ini juga sangat bervariasi. Jika kamu memilih untuk tinggal di studio apartment kamu akan mengeluarkan setidaknya € 300 - € 500 per bulan. Kamu juga bisa berbagi tempat tinggal dengan temanmu untuk mengurangi pengeluaran. Atau kamu bisa juga tinggal di apartemen 1 kamar biasa. Tapi, kamu harus merogoh kocek yang agak dalam yaitu sekitar € 800 - € 1000.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Biaya Kuliah</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Untuk biaya kuliah di Le Cordon Bleu memang bervariasi. Hal ini disesuaikan dengan tingkat pendidikan yang ingin kamu kejar. Berikut perkiraan rata-rata biaya kuliah di Le Cordon Bleu untuk program <em>Certificate</em>, <em>Diploma</em>, <em>Bachelor</em>, dan <em>MBA</em>:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td>Kualifikasi</td><td>Dalam Euro</td></tr><tr><td>Certificate</td><td>€ 6.500</td></tr><tr><td>Diploma</td><td>€ 13.000</td></tr><tr><td>Bachelor</td><td>€ 14.000/tahun</td></tr><tr><td>MBA</td><td>€27.000</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Biaya Transportasi</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Biaya transportasi tentunya juga harus kamu perhitungkan dengan baik. Sebagai siswa internasional, kamu pasti ingin mengeksplor kota baru tempat tinggalmu, atau bahkan hanya untuk bepergian dari rumah ke sekolah. Untuk pelajar, kamu bisa berlangganan kartu transportasi per tahunnya hanya € 333.90. Ini adalah alternatif yang jauh lebih murah dibanding taksi dimana kamu harus membayar € 40 per jam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Memang kalau dilihat-lihat pengeluaranmu di sana cukup banyak, mulai dari akomodasi, biaya kuliah, hingga transportasi. Tapi biaya tersebut masih bisa dibilang jauh lebih murah dibandingkan di Amerika Serikat atau di Inggris. Walaupun demikian, kualitas pendidikan yang ditawarkan pun tidak kalah hebat. Buktinya ada banyak chef hebat yang terkenal dan sukses yang merupakan lulusan dari jurusan tata boga di Le Cordon Bleu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Download Panduan “University Preparation Guidebook: Scholarship Edition” untuk mencari tahu semua hal yang perlu kamu ketahui sebelum mendaftar beasiswa.

Simak berikut ini beberapa hal yang perlu kamu tahu mengenai syarat masuk ke jurusan tata boga.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sekolah kuliner di seluruh dunia berusaha untuk mengubah siswa mereka menjadi koki ahli. Di sini, kamu akan belajar cara memasak, menyiapkan, dan menyajikan makanan sambil juga memahami cara mengelola seluruh restoran. Sekolah kuliner mempunyai tantangan itu sendiri. Walaupun begitu, ini adalah salah satu jalur terbaik yang bisa kamu ambil untuk menjadi seorang koki.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Ilmu Tata Boga</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mengejar gelar sarjana atau gelar associate dalam seni kuliner adalah cara terbaik untuk memasuki dunia masakan yang mewah. Kamu bisa memaksimalkan keterampilan dan pengetahuan memasak kamu, belajar tentang manajemen dan aspek bisnis dalam menjalankan restoran, dan mendapatkan paparan berbagai masakan dari seluruh dunia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meskipun silabus dan mata pelajaran yang akan kamu pelajari akan bergantung pada spesialisasi yang kamu pilih, berikut adalah beberapa topik umum yang mungkin kamu pelajari selama belajar ilmu tata boga:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Table service</li><li>Menu planning</li><li>International cuisine</li><li>Baking</li><li>Food science</li><li>Food safety management</li><li>Finance</li><li>Introduction to marketing</li><li>Brand management</li><li>Entrepreneurship</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Apa saja syarat masuk jurusan tata boga?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Untuk masuk ke sekolah kuliner, kamu memerlukan beberapa hal untuk bisa diterima di salah satu akademi internasional terbaik di dunia.

Sementara mempelajari cara menggunakan alat dan perlengkapan khusus bergantung pada sekolah, kualitas lainnya hanya datang dengan latihan. Berikut adalah beberapa softskill yang perlu kamu milik untuk bisa masuk ke jurusan tata boga:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Kreativitas</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Menjadi seorang koki bukan hanya tentang memasak dengan cepat tetapi juga tentang merancang resep baru dan menemukan metode penyajian yang baru. Tanpa kreativitas, hampir mustahil untuk menjadikannya sebagai koki.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Etos kerja yang kuat</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Melakukan shift ganda di restoran, menyiapkan makanan tepat waktu, dan mengorbankan waktu yang seharusnya kamu habiskan bersama teman dan keluarga adalah ritual peralihan untuk menjadi koki.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Daya tahan fisik</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Saat berada di dapur, kamu diharapkan bekerja dalam waktu lama tanpa istirahat. Dan kamu harus melakukan semua itu di dapur yang panas. Secara alami, kamu harus membangun ketahanan fisik untuk dapat melakukannya.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tangkas</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sebagai koki, kamu harus mencampur, mengiris, merakit, memotong, meremas, mencuci, dan melakukan segala macam hal manual sambil juga menjaga meja dan lengan baju kamu tetap bersih.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Detail</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Satu kesalahan, dan hidangan kamu akan terasa tidak enak, pelanggan akan tidak puas, dan reputasi kamu dan restoran mungkin akan turun. Jika kamu tidak belajar bagaimana menjadi sempurna dalam memasak, segala sesuatunya dapat dengan mudah berantakan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Apa sulit untuk memenuhi syarat masuk jurusan tata boga?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tingkat penerimaan untuk seni kuliner berbeda untuk universitas memang berbeda. Sementara perguruan tinggi top seperti Le Cordon Bleu dan Institut pendidikan Kuliner tentu saja jauh lebih sulit dan menantang.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Namun, ada satu perbedaan antara perguruan tinggi biasa dan sekolah kuliner. Sekolah kuliner tidak hanya akan melihat skor dan resume kamu, tetapi juga mempertimbangkan pengalaman memasak kamu. Sebagai tambahan, kalau kamu mampu menunjukan semangatmu tentang memasak dan menunjukan banyak pengalamanmu dengan makanan, maka peluang mu masuk tentunya juga akan menjadi lebih tinggi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banyak juga kan persiapan dan syarat masuk ke jurusan tata boga yang harus kamu tahu?

They\'ve got a lot on their plate: managing their social life, keeping up with schoolwork, deadlines for university applications, and the list goes on. A private <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/this-is-why-you-need-a-tutor-for-your-university-application/\">tutor</a> can guide students to navigate this stressful period, offering advice while also preparing students with the knowledge, skills, and understanding to get the best outcome possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how can a student benefit from having a private tutor?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Benefits of Having a Private Tutor</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Personalized Approach and Pace</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s easy for students to feel lost in the shuffle at school; after all, there are numerous things to grasp.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At school, teachers are often hard-pressed to answer the needs of every student to the extent they would like. Moreover, they must follow a set pace to complete the syllabus planned for the academic year. Knowing that every student is unique, some will be able to learn quicker than the average while others will need more time to process information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Private tutors help overcome this by offering one-on-one support and tailoring their lessons to each student\'s needs so that every student\'s unique needs are being met.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what subject you\'re struggling with in your studies—whether it\'s math or chemistry—you\'ll have someone who understands what you\'re going through and can guide you to understand all the materials well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Develop Independent Learning Skills</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>High school study offers a great deal of freedom, but university study is a whole other level. Many courses offer only a few hours of contact time with the professors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s easy to get overwhelmed by this new level of independence and responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where independent learning skills are needed. At ALL-in, private tutors are able to help students develop this set of skills in several ways. Therefore, they can first use self-assessment and goal-setting techniques to help them identify what they need to work on. From this, students will have the encouragement to address the areas where they feel any difficulties with their current level of understanding or performance. The tutor can then provide specific learning strategies and study schedules for improving these areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Improves Confidence</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>University can be incredibly stressful, especially for students who struggle with confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A private tutor can help students to establish their confidence by improving their self-confidence. Through the one-on-one approach, tutors will be able to identify where a student\'s self-doubt is coming from and alleviate these issues by creating a learning plan that directly addresses these problem areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, private tutors are using positive reinforcement and creating a safe environment for students to work in. With this, they are able to express any questions they might have without the restriction of the fear of being judged by their classmates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Open More Opportunities</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main reasons for having a private tutor is that it unlocks future opportunities. Since universities take grades into account in the admissions process, better performance at school can open doors to better universities and jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, will you consider having a private tutor?

They not only act as your mentor but also as your friend and brainstorming buddy. Let\'s find out more below!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is a university admissions consultant?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/university-admissions-consultant-reliable-partner-for-your-application/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">university admissions consultant</a> is a consultant who works with a student to help them with their application to get into a college or university. The goal of a university admissions consultant is on getting the student into a school or program by guiding the student toward the right schools, programs, and careers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Download “University Preparation Guidebook: Scholarship Edition” Guidebook to find out all the things you need to know before applying for scholarships. It\'s FREE, <a href=\"https://scholarship-guide.all-inedu.com/\">download here</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3 Benefits of a University Admissions Consultant</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Relieve the College Application Stress</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To most high school students, the prospect of creating a college application and applying to schools is daunting. It can be difficult to organize and research all the information needed to apply to schools, and that is exactly what a university admissions consultant is for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>University admissions consultants help you make a clear timeline to organize your activities. When is the right time to start an extracurricular, or to study for a standardized test? Some of these things are subject to change, and a university admissions consultant is up to date when it comes to these changes. They are responsible for mapping out each step in the process, though the student must also keep up and remain consistent with the plan for it to be efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Develop a Strategy for Tackling the Undergraduate Admissions Process</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever wondered how difficult it is to get into a certain school, or wondered what tips and tricks can help you land into them? University admissions consultants are there to answer your questions on these topics. Ask important and detailed questions early and pay careful attention to these replies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>University admissions consultants also help you set up a balanced school list. Your school list shouldn\'t only be a list of the top universities; instead, there are three categories of schools students normally put on their school lists.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Reach schools: Also known as top or dream schools. These are schools that are difficult to get into, with acceptance rates of under 30 or 20 percent.</li><li>Target schools: Schools that you may have a shot at. If you have good test scores or grades, there is a chance you may be able to get into these schools.</li><li>Safety schools: These are schools where you have over an 80% chance of acceptance. You can be certain that you\'ll be accepted to these schools.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>University admissions consultants carefully assess your applications to see if they can give you a good chance to get into a certain school. However, you must also remember that nothing in life is guaranteed. There is a chance that you can\'t get into your dream school. Additionally, there is also a chance you can get rejected by a safety school while getting accepted to a target or reach school. Sometimes, getting into a college requires luck. University admissions consultants are there to help you organize your activities and scores to give you the best chance of getting into the school you want. Your success and happiness are your consultant\'s priorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tell the Right Story in Each Application</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>More top schools and universities tend to go test-optional, choosing to emphasize the importance of supplemental essays instead. As a result, crafting a personal narrative has become an increasingly essential skill for college applications. To create an interesting and intriguing portrait of a student, university admissions consultants must help students discover experiences and values that matter most to them, and communicate these with clarity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A university admissions consultant must guide their student to reflect and brainstorm with a couple of new, challenging questions. These questions help a student give voice to certain topics and reveal maturity and growth, as well as help a student find out what they want from life. University admissions consultants must also aid their students with verbalizing and putting into writing episodes of their life that have made them who they are now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A university admissions consultant is there to help you get into a good school.

There are so many factors that go into building your application—your professional experiences, academic transcripts, extracurricular activities, essays, letters of recommendation—and making sure they\'re all at the best level possible. Moreover, this is where a university application consultant comes in. Also, they help maximize your chances of getting into your dream school. But, how? Let\'s find out here!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is a university application consultant?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A<a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/university-admissions-consultant-reliable-partner-for-your-application/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\"> university application consultant</a> works with a student throughout every step of the university application process.

In contrast with the educational agents that connect students with universities, a university application consultant has a role in guiding and helping students to write their personal statements, choose the right university, and navigate the admissions process. They can advise students on what they need in order to get into their dream school and what other factors are important when applying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Download “University Preparation Guidebook: Scholarship Edition” Guidebook to find out all the things you need to know before applying for scholarships.

This is due to the ease of submitting multiple applications through online application portals like the University of California application system and the Common Application.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\'s an overview of the acceptance rates of top universities in the United States in the latest admissions cycle:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Harvard University: 4.59%</li><li>Stanford University: 4.3%</li><li>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT): 6.7%</li><li>UC Berkeley: 11-14%</li><li>UCLA: 12%</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With a bigger application pool, it\'s harder than ever for applicants to stand out. A university application consultant helps you understand what schools want by providing insight into the admissions process, how they evaluate applications, and how to tailor your application accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Detailed application process</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting into your dream university requires thoughtful planning from years ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, how did you spend your time in high school? Are you involved in volunteering activities, or do you have any internship experiences? What have you accomplished that sets yourself apart from others?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A university application consultant helps you build your stories throughout high school so your applications are well put when it\'s time to apply. Not only do they help you craft a unique story that highlights your strengths and interests, but they\'ll also make sure that all of your essays are cohesive and compelling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Offering a neutral perspective</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, families can be emotionally involved in deciding where a student should attend university (e.g. close to home, siblings\' or parents\' alma mater).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many factors at play, it is harder for students to make their own decisions about the university that is right for them. A university application consultant can be involved in offering a different perspective while also helping students to land the best outcome. After all, they want the student to attend a school that best fits them socially, academically, and financially.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need a university application consultant to season your application?

Admission rates are higher than ever. However, students are not always prepared for the academic and social expectations of the university. Even for those that are, it is a unique process to apply and gain admission prior to college. It is important that you get all the help you need as soon as possible before it is too late.

Still in doubt whether you need a UAC? Take a look below to have more insight about it!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is a </strong>University Admissions Consultant<strong>?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An admissions consultant assists an individual student with their application for admission to a particular institution or university\'s program. A UAC uses the student\'s <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/get-to-know-all-about-university-education-consultant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">educational</a> interests and career ambitions to help direct the student toward the right university, the right programs, and the right career.

It\'s FREE, <a href=\"https://scholarship-guide.all-inedu.com/\">download here</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What Benefits Can You Get From a UAC?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In essence, college admissions consulting helps you choose the schools that are the best fit for you while also providing you with strategic assistance and appropriate direction throughout the application and essay-writing procedures. <strong>Mentors</strong> or UACsmay also give you assistance with choosing courses, financial aid, career counseling, test preparation, and more. But it does not stop there. There are a lot of benefits you can get from having a mentor or a UAC. These benefits are:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. Personalized Support</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although guidance counselors from school are an enormous help, many of them are just overburdened. They have a lot of students to assist, therefore it is impossible to provide each one of the students with individualized input. Instead, having a mentor will provide you with the personalized support you need to successfully navigate the college admissions process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Higher Chance of Acceptance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A mentor cannot individually ensure acceptance, but they can raise the likelihood by directing you to a university that is better suited to your requirements. This assists in eliminating pointless applications to institutions that might be unable to provide the student with what they are seeking.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Get Rid of Unnecessary Stress</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Eliminating unneeded stress for students and parents is one of the many amazing benefits that you can get from having a mentor or university admissions consultant. You will get insider assistance so that you won\'t have to worry about deadlines, or what might or might not impress the university.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. Assistance in Identifying an Area of Focus</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A confused student will have complete assistance from mentors in choosing a specialty area or major because they have comprehensive knowledge of many different universities, majors, and other topics. In turn, you will have a clear path toward the best-suited top university and program where you have the best chance of succeeding and flourishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>5. The Best Investment for Future</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hiring a consultant or counselor with experience in college admissions is a wise financial decision. For instance, it can assist you in creating a specific college career plan and help them graduate on time. Therefore, you will have a personal supporting unit to make sure you do everything on time with your planned goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How Does a University Admission Consultant Help Students?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentors or UACs will help you with everything you need regarding your university preparation. Not only that, but you will also get academic support in regards to how to maintain your grades, what kind of grades you will need for a specific major and many other things. Here is the complete list of what a UAC can help you with:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Essay Writing Strategy</li><li>Improved Standardized Test Score</li><li>Building Personal Brand</li><li>Identifying the Right Extracurricular Activities</li><li>Career Exploration</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Mentor\'s Big Role in the Admission Process</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when they meet all the major requirements, students frequently fail to enroll in the university they want to attend. Ignorance of several crucial events, like on-the-spot admissions, admissions at the last minute, and admissions for specific seats, is one of the issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The expert admission advisors can assist you in making the most of them because they are familiar with these and many other varieties of admittance scenarios. They have accumulated a wealth of knowledge and experience over the years and are aware of when to apply. Therefore, even when all hope seems lost, a skilled mentor or a university admissions consultant can still make things happen for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How to Find the Right </strong>University Admissions Consultant<strong>?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the big question, isn\'t it?

Situated in the hills of Ithaca, <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/full-scoop-on-cornell-university-profile-just-for-you!/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Cornell University\'s (opens in a new tab)\">Cornell University\'s</a> campus is a hotbed for innovation and collaboration. Moreover, with its classic brick buildings and stately grounds, it\'s no surprise that this Ivy League school has been named one of the most beautiful college campuses in America. In this article, we\'ll dive deep into the Cornell University ranking!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cornell University, at a Glance&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1865, Cornell University was founded by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White as a land-grant university. The university has since grown from its humble beginnings as a small college to what it is today: a large research institution with schools across Ithaca, New York, and Qatar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of September 2021, Cornell has been affiliated with 61 Nobel laureates, four Turing Award winners, and 63 Olympic Medalists. Since its founding, Cornell has been a co-educational school with no racial or religious requirements for admission. Also, Cornell boasts a diverse student body of nearly 26,000 students, with about 24% coming from abroad.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cornell University Ranking</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to its ranking, Cornell University stands 12th domestically and 20th globally according to the latest QS World University Rankings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Applying to Cornell University</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cornell has nine academic colleges, each with its academic requirements, admissions, and specialties. Before applying, you should pick a college that you would like to attend.

Brooks School of Public Policy</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While each Cornell college has its own majors and specific graduation requirements, some majors cross over multiple colleges. For example, the major of Biological Sciences is available in both the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Since the courses, specializations, and requirements for the major are similar across both colleges, it is advised to make your decision according to your secondary interests.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Common App</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When applying to Cornell, you will use the Common Application (also known as the Common App), a centralized online portal for undergraduate applications. In addition to the Common App essays, you will also need to write two supplemental essays. Therefore each applicant can differentiate themselves and demonstrate their interest in attending Cornell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some prompts for Cornell\'s supplemental essays:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>College of Architecture, Art, and Planning:</strong> What is your \"thing\"? What energizes you or engages you so deeply that you lose track of time? Everyone has different passions, obsessions, quirks, and inspirations.

Using your personal, academic, or volunteer/work experiences, describe the topics or issues that you care about and why they are important to you.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>College of Engineering:</strong> How do your interests directly connect with Cornell Engineering? If you have an intended major, what draws you to that department at Cornell Engineering?

It may be helpful to concentrate on one or two things that you are most excited about.</li><li><strong>School of Industrial and Labor Relations</strong>: Using your personal, academic, or volunteer/work experiences, describe the topics or issues that you care about and why they are important to you. Furthermore, your response should show us that your interests align with the ILR School.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the undergraduate admissions deadline for Cornell\'s admissions:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Early Decision: November 1</li><li>Financial Aid: November 1</li><li>Regular Decision: January 2</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While Cornell is among one of the most competitive schools in the world, it is possible to gain admission if you go the extra mile.

Or the school where American politicians Henry Kissinger and Bill Clinton did a lecture at? Furthermore, it\'s Tsinghua University, which has an outstanding reputation for academic excellence and innovative research. Let\'s dive deep into the Tsinghua University ranking in this article!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>About Tsinghua University&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 1911 in the wake of the anti-colonialist Boxer Rebellion, <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/uncover-the-full-scoop-and-insight-of-tsinghua-university/\">Tsinghua University</a> is considered as the first educational institution of the People\'s Republic of China.

Furthermore, as one of the most prestigious universities in the world, it has attracted students from all over the globe. In this article, let\'s learn more about the Princeton University ranking.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Princeton University, at a Glance&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 1746 as the fourth-oldest college in the United States,<a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/princeton-university-complete-and-thorough-profile-breakdown/\"> Princeton</a> was first known as the College of New Jersey. Moreover, it was founded by the New Light Presbyterians in Elizabeth to train its ministers.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Princeton has nearly 10,000 students in total. Furthermore, its main campus, spreading over 500 acres of land, is famous for its spectacular greenery. There are over 180 buildings on its land, some of which were designed by famous architects such as Thomas Jefferson and Frank Gehry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Princeton University Ranking</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the latest QS World University Rankings, Princeton University ranked 16th globally and 8th in the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the QS World University Rankings by Subject, the following are a few Princeton subjects that rank in the top 15:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Politics - 5th&nbsp;</li><li>Arts and Humanities - 15th&nbsp;</li><li>Economics and Econometrics - 7th</li><li>English Language and Literature - 7th&nbsp;</li><li>Mathematics - 7th&nbsp;</li><li>History - 10th&nbsp;</li><li>Earth and Marine Sciences - 11th&nbsp;</li><li>Chemical Engineering - 12th</li><li>Computer Science and Information Systems - 13th&nbsp;</li><li>Statistics and Operational Research - 11th&nbsp;</li><li>Sociology - 10th&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are several notable Princeton rankings, according to US News Best Colleges 2022 list:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>#1 National Universities</li><li>#3 Best Undergraduate Teaching</li><li>#8 Computer Science&nbsp;</li><li>#9 Biocomputing/Bioinformatics/Biotechnology</li><li>#10 Programming Languages</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Princeton University Acceptance&nbsp; Rate&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All Ivy League schools have an incredibly low acceptance rate compared to other schools, and Princeton is no exception. As such, it comes as no surprise that the acceptance rate for Princeton University is very low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Princeton has decided to withhold its most recent admissions statistics. This includes information on the school\'s early and regular round admittance rates, the overall number of applicants, the demographics of admitted students, as well as its&nbsp; SAT and GPA data. However, based on past data, it is estimated that the acceptance rate at Princeton university would be between 3% and 4%.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past five years, Princeton has been getting increasingly competitive, with the acceptance rate dropping by over 30% in five years. Moreover, in the 2021 admissions cycle, there were 37,601 applications submitted for a place at Princeton. Furthermore, only 1,498 students received their acceptance letters. Also, this brought the acceptance rate down to 3.98%, which stands as the lowest in the school\'s history.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Princeton\'s World-Class Education</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Primarily a liberal arts college focused on research, Princeton offers students the option to enroll in either the Bachelor of Arts (B.A) program or the Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E) program.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the B.S.E degree only includes six programs, there are 33 programs available in the B.A&nbsp; degree. In each graduating class, around 25% of students pursue the B.S.E. program, while others choose to follow the B.A. degree program.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crossing through the hurdles to get into Princeton University is surely a stressful stage. Moreover, as an Ivy League institution, Princeton is famous for its rigorous admissions process. Nevertheless, with an education that stands among the top in the world, a Princeton education is something you shouldn\'t miss out on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dreaming of studying at Princeton?

Let\'s look at some of the best <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/read-the-full-scoop-on-seoul-national-university-here/\">Seoul National University</a> Majors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Materials Science&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Engineering applications, the physics and chemistry of matter, as well as industrial manufacturing processes are all included in the interdisciplinary field of materials science. Modern society heavily relies on cutting-edge materials, such as silicon microchips for the ongoing digital technology revolution, lightweight composites for more fuel-efficient automobiles, and optical fibers for telecommunications. Materials scientists research the connections between a material\'s composition, structure, and properties. Additionally, they create novel materials and sophisticated manufacturing methods. Nanotechnology, quantum computing, energy storage, nuclear energy, and medical innovations like bone replacement materials and drug delivery all depend on advancements in materials science.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Clinical Medicine</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The practice and study of medicine based on the direct examination of the patient is the main focus of the medical field known as clinical medicine. In contrast, other scientific disciplines place a greater emphasis on the concepts and fundamentals of medicine. Clinicians evaluate patients in clinical medicine to identify, treat, and prevent disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Condensed Matter Physics</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The study of the macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of matter is a focus of condensed matter physics. Scientists who specialize in condensed matter investigate how matter is created from several interacting atoms and electrons as well as the physical characteristics that result from these interactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Condensed matter physics is typically divided into two categories: \"soft\" condensed matter physics, which examines the non-quantum aspects of matter, and \"hard\" condensed matter physics, which studies the quantum properties of matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Oncology</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The area of medicine known as oncology is dedicated to detecting and managing cancer. Furthermore, it comprises surgical oncology (the use of surgery and other procedures to treat cancer), radiation oncology, and medical oncology . The use of pharmaceuticals like chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and other medications to treat cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This field is very special because cancer is also a special condition. In addition to affecting blood cells, cancer can also result in blood cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma. Due to the unchecked expansion of the abnormal (malignant) cells in the bone marrow, many blood malignancies also result in a reduction in normal blood cell synthesis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unchecked expansion of cancer cells typically overwhelms the body over time or spreads to an area of the body that is vital to survival.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Gastroenterology</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gastroenterology is the study of conditions affecting the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum, pancreas, gallbladder, bile ducts, and liver as well as their normal function. It requires a thorough understanding of the physiology of the gastrointestinal organs and their typical functions. Moreover, this includes the motility—or movement—of substances through the stomach and intestines, the digestion and absorption of nutrients into the body, the elimination of waste products from the system, and the role of the liver as a digestive organ. It covers prevalent and significant illnesses such as hepatitis, gastric reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, colitis, gallbladder and biliary tract disease, nutritional issues, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), colon polyps, and cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The list of Seoul National University Majors above helps to make the world a better place.

Maka dari itu, akan lebih mudah menjalani perkuliahan jika kamu adalah salah satu murid yang menyukai dunia politik. Hal ini bisa kamu simpulkan dari ketertarikanmu sejak di bangku sekolah. Jika kamu suka untuk mengetahui berita terkini seputar perpolitikan, kamu mungkin akan cocok di jurusan ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salah satu politik dunia yang mungkin kamu ketahui adalah konflik yang sedang terjadi antara Rusia dan Ukraina. Kalau kamu sering melihat di berita, ada beberapa perwakilan dari negara masing-masing yang menyampaikan pendapat mereka di PBB. Itu salah satu tugas yang akan diemban seorang lulusan<a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/id/serba-serbi-jurusan-hubungan-internasional-yang-wajib-kamu-ketahui/\"> jurusan hubungan internasional </a>lho!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Syarat Masuk Jurusan Hubungan Internasional: <strong>Kemampuan Berpikir Kritis</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Berpikir kritis itu WAJIB! Di jurusan ini, kamu akan mempelajari berbagai macam peristiwa dan masalah global dari berbagai macam sudut pandang. Yang artinya, kamu akan belajar membelah dan menganalisa semua sudut pandang yang ada. Kemampuan untuk berpikir kritis akan banyak digunakan di jurusan ini. Apalagi kalau kamu berencana untuk menjadi diplomat, kamu harus sudah membiasakan dan melatih kemampuan ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Keterampilan Bahasa Asing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sangat penting untuk seorang mahasiswa jurusan hubungan internasional untuk menguasai bahasa asing. Kenapa? Karena di sini kamu akan berhubungan dengan perwakilan dari negara lain. Kamu harus setidaknya bisa berbahasa inggris agar mampu berkomunikasi dengan mereka. Akan lebih baik jika kamu mampu menguasai beberapa bahasa lainnya.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart</em>.”</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Menjalin hubungan dengan negara lain tidak melupakan hubungan antara kamu dengan perwakilan dari negara tersebut. Kadang, baik atau tidaknya hubungan antar 2 negara itu bergantung pada baik atau tidaknya hubungan kedua perwakilan negara tersebut lho.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Syarat Masuk Jurusan Hubungan Internasional: <strong>Kemampuan Public Speaking</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ini adalah salah satu kemampuan yang perlu kamu punya dan kamu miliki. Apa kamu pernah lihat beberapa perwakilan dari sebuah negara memberikan pernyataan di sidang PBB? Yup, itu adalah beberapa hal yang akan kamu kerjakan untuk menjaga nama baik negaramu di mata dunia. Jangan diremehkan ya! Tidak mudah lho untuk berbicara di depan umum.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Mampu Bernegosiasi</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yang terakhir ini juga merupakan salah satu kemampuan penting yang sangat dibutuhkan oleh seorang yang ingin berkuliah di jurusan hubungan internasional. <em>Skill</em> ini harus kamu kembangkan dengan baik jika kamu ingin menjadi diplomat di masa depan nanti. Bayangkan saja, seorang diplomat yang sedang berada di misi perdamaian, harus pintar bernegosiasi untuk kepentingan negaramu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bagaimana?

Moreover, it is the department that helps employees develop their skills, knowledge, and abilities to improve an organization\'s effectiveness. In this article, we will look at how this department helps organizations reach their goals!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is Human Resource Development?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Human Resource Development, also known as HRD, is responsible for managing the growth of employees\' hard and soft skills, knowledge, ability, and talents. Furthermore, Human Resource Development can be defined as organized learning activities. Moreover, They are carried out within a company to enhance performance and foster personal development to achieve self-fulfillment and help the organization accomplish its goals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HRD Department\'s activities are important to develop a highly productive and superior workforce while also reducing turnover rates. Their scope includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Employee training</li><li>Career development</li><li>Performance management and development&nbsp;</li><li>Coaching</li><li>Mentoring</li><li>Tuition assistance&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Human Resource Development usually takes into account the needs of an organization to create measurable changes and improvements. Their implementation can be divided into two groups:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. <strong>Informal learning&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Informal learning involves seeking out individuals with higher levels of skill and knowledge to learn from them. Moreover, this usually happens spontaneously and without a particular purpose in mind. Furthermore, an example of informal learning comes from sharing experiences over a cup of coffee. Also, through the exchange of work-related stories, workers can learn from each other\'s experiences. Another example is when new employees are faced with difficult or unusual tasks that require collaboration with highly trained colleagues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. <strong>Formal learning</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Formal learning has relation with professional courses, typically within a classroom where expert trainers, mentors, and instructors impart knowledge to learners while following a particular curriculum. Lectures, practical projects, corporate training workshops, tutorials, and professional seminars are a few examples of formal learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Duties of Human Resource Development&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The task of Human Resource Development varies based on the size of the company, the sector it operates in, the number of employees, and the company\'s objectives. Moreover, the general responsibilities of Human Resource Development in a company include:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. <strong>Strategic talent acquisition&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure the best talents enter a company\'s workforce, there needs to be a selection process. Furthermore, this is where Human Resource Development comes into play, covering the stages of preparation, recruitment, and selection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of their duties includes attracting people to work for the company and selecting the right candidates. Furthermore, they may talk to a department manager or supervisor to learn about a vacant position, along with its requirements and ideal candidate qualities. They may later set forth a recruiting strategy, including creating internal and external job postings, screening incoming applicants\' resumes and other application materials, and conducting interviews.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Developing training and development plans&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To retain talent and remain competitive, Human Resource Development is responsible for designing employee development plans. Moreover, this could involve providing employees with on-the-job training, professional development programs, or peer-learning opportunities to promote growth and development in the company\'s workforce. In doing so, aside from boosting employee productivity and reducing turnover rates, the development and training plans may also raise employees\' job satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From hiring to development, the Human Resources Department is an integral part of organizations. Furthermore, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that the employment outlook for human resources managers will increase by 9% between 2020 and 2030.

Furthermore, this skill is important in building strong employee-company relationships and suggests that you may be skilled in counseling, employee advocacy, and workplace programs that promote healthy relationships between coworkers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Legal Knowledge</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Human Resources Department acts as the governing body of an organization.

This job requires you to hone some of your human resource skills to perfection. Why? You are going to work with the employees, one of the most important aspects of your company. Here are some skills that are required to succeed in the industry!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Interpersonal Skills</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most significant HR soft skills are interpersonal abilities. After all, \"human\" is the first component of \"human resources.\" Interacting with employees makes up the majority of an&nbsp; HR&nbsp; officer\'s duties. Making a good impression is crucial because HR personnel is frequently the first company representatives potential workers interact with throughout the hiring process. The department acts as the organization\'s spokesperson and an ally for the workers. These people have a significant impact on the workplace culture and can make employees feel secure and at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Human Resource Skills: <strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important HR skills is emotional intelligence, which is the capacity to recognize and appropriately respond to emotions. HR workers can better understand and connect with employees by exercising a high EQ. The trust and cooperation of coworkers are frequently gained by HR professionals through recognizing and honoring feelings and experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Confidentiality</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most crucial HR skills is keeping information private. The HR&nbsp; department has access to private data such as employees\' personal information, performance reviews, and payroll data. Employees occasionally confide in one another about personal matters, including health challenges, family conflicts, and precarious living arrangements. Additionally, HR is frequently the first division to learn about significant organizational changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Human Resource Skills: <strong>Active Listening</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The organization\'s ears are in the HR department. Employees can voice their questions and complaints to HR. Moreover, these team members use employee engagement surveys to get input from the employees. Coworkers consult HR for advice when they are experiencing personal or professional issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Active listening is a must skill for HR professionals for two key reasons. First, HR needs to frequently record talks, and being attentive helps HR to produce thorough reports. Second, the practice gives employees a sense of respect and inclusion. If employees believe that HR&nbsp; managers are concerned about their issues, they will appreciate HR more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Recruiting</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not merely a job description–recruiting requires a particular set of skills. HR specialists are skilled at creating engaging job postings, luring and vetting prospective applicants, conducting interviews, and making hiring decisions. Moreover, to develop solid hiring criteria, competent recruiters work with the hiring department. Furthermore, by utilizing social media, business gatherings, and referral networks, HR creates pools of qualified candidates. Moreover, HR specialists are knowledgeable about hiring best practices and how to use resources like applicant tracking systems. Also, timing is a skill that these people have perfected. The finest HR&nbsp; directors understand when to make an offer and how to pace the interview process. Talented recruiters are adept at assessing prospects on various criteria, including technical aptitude, disposition, and cultural fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Human Resource Skills: <strong>Conflict Management</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Resolving workplace disagreements is one of HR\'s primary responsibilities. Teammate disputes are also frequently resolved by the department. HR must provide a safe environment for staff to work through problems and assist in identifying practical solutions. Furthermore, the HR team should be able to diffuse conflict, promote active listening, nudge the conversation in the direction of solutions, and broker agreements. HR encourages discussion and allows each party enough time to present their position. Effective mediators keep an eye out for underlying issues and address them when they come up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With these HR skills in your arsenal, you will be able to achieve the great career progression and growth you want. But, before you get into your career, you need to make sure that you get into the best university to have a good foundation for your future.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s get you into a top university through an initial consultation with ALL-in!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we can do for you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Maximize your university entrance preparation with <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/admissions-mentoring/\">Admission Mentoring</a>.</li><li>Explore your interests and dive into different industries through <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/passionxplorer/\">Career Exploration.</a></li><li>Improve your grades and knowledge through <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/academic-test-preparation/\">Academic Tutoring.</a></li><li>Sharpen your top university preparation with <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/program/academic-test-preparation/\">SAT/ACT Prep Class</a>.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s #TakeOnYourFuture with ALL-in Eduspace!

They manage talent and employees to ensure that they work properly and maximally. The scope of Human Resource Management (HRM) is very wide. They need to be the mediator between a company and their employees. Let\'s take a look at the full scope below!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Human Resource Evaluation</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A comprehensive evaluation of a&nbsp; company\'s current HR&nbsp; comes first in all HRM functions. It entails assessing the current payroll to see if it is proportionate to the amount of work. This provides insight into whether an organization\'s positions are adequate or whether there are too many of them. The entire procedure is also known as HR&nbsp; planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the evaluation process, the HR division might stretch some individuals to learn the maximum load of each person. This is an important step to know whether all of the employees have maximized their potential in their work, whether the current employee is enough, or whether they need to recruit new employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Scope of Human Resource Management: <strong>Analyzing Jobs in the Company</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HRM includes obtaining detail information on each job title in the organization and what type of person that is suitable to fill a vacancy. This helps in laying the groundwork for locating and choosing the best people for the business. The business\' budget must also be taken into consideration when performing a job analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While doing the job analysis, HR will go around all divisions and have a discussion (sometimes negotiation) with each manager to know how many people and what kind of person the division needs. Communication skills are important for this task as HR needs to discuss this further with the higher-ups.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Interview and Selection</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The selection of the ideal candidate is the following stage in the HR scope. The ideal applicant would be one who–in addition to having the necessary academic credentials–fits the company\'s culture. Creating the qualifications for a certain job title is one of HRM\'s tasks. Choosing how many steps to include in the interview selection process would fall under the purview and responsibilities of HRM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview and selection is a very long and draining process. You will meet a lot of individuals with different talents and personalities. In this stage, the HR division will make the crucial decision on who is going to join the company, who is going on their waitlist, and who is going to be declined.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Scope of Human Resource Management: <strong>Orientation</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The candidate is then presented with the company\'s work culture, ethics, and surroundings after being chosen. He receives orientation from both the manager and the team he will be working with. This aids in increasing the new employee\'s comfort level. The goal of the induction procedure is to familiarize the employee with the company\'s values. It\'s a non-formal procedure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being non-formal, this is one of the most important processes in an employee\'s journey. This is the welcoming stage of their career in the company. The HR needs to make sure to have a great and thorough introduction to the company, the people, and the essence of the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Employee Growth Opportunities</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Employees\' loyalty increases as a company provides better prospects for growth. How to keep employees motivated and win their loyalty is part of the nature and purview of HRM. An HR officer is the best person to examine employees\' prior performance and go over potential future career growth prospects with him because they have access to all information regarding employees\' performance. If conducted periodically, a performance review that has ties to rewards and raises inspires workers to meet ever-higher goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When talking about employee growth, we are not only talking about raises. This is because some growth may sometimes need HR to take initiative in applying employees to classes to improve their skills. But of course, one of the essential things to develop employees is to add more responsibility. With great responsibility, sometimes an employee also needs a great raise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an ever-changing and always-improving world, the scope of human resource management will also change. In the past, there was no such thing as working from home. Now, especially during the pandemic, HR needs to manage employees scattered around the nation, maybe around the world. Therefore, being an HR officer will require you to be constantly learning and developing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is human resource management a good fit for you?

A good way to get yourself into gear is by doing the SAT practice test. In this article, we\'ll find out the different sections of the SAT as well as the strategies you can follow to boost your SAT score!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the SAT?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The SAT is a standardized test used by colleges and universities across different countries to help them evaluate potential students by testing their critical thinking skills. Its goal is to assess a student\'s ability and readiness for college courses in three academic areas—reading, writing, and math.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>SAT: In-depth&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Reading section has passages that are taken from US and World Literature, History/Social Studies, and Science. Charts, graphs, and tables are some of the graphical data representations that might be used in the passages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Below is an example of an SAT question from this section:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Which choice best describes the developmental pattern of the passage?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A) A careful analysis of a traditional practice</p>\n\n\n\n<p>B) A detailed depiction of a meaningful encounter</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C) A definitive response to a series of questions</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D) A cheerful recounting of an amusing anecdote</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the Writing & Language section, there are 4 passages total, each with 400 to 450 words. The passages range from arguments to nonfiction narratives, with topics such as career paths, history, social studies, the humanities, and science.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Below is an example of an SAT question from this section:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Which choice most accurately and effectively represents the information in the graph?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A) NO CHANGE</p>\n\n\n\n<p>B) to 12 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C) to their lowest point on December 13.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D) to 10 degrees Fahrenheit and stay there for months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SAT Math is divided into two subsections: a No Calculator part and a Calculator part. The test focuses on three major areas that you will likely encounter in college, including:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Heart of Algebra&nbsp;</li><li>Problem Solving and Data Analysis&nbsp;</li><li>Passport to Advanced Math&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Below is an example of an SAT question from the No Calculator part:&nbsp;</strong><br></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8yto9QGeRvqdfus-1Ppo3InmhT55yC4UYAWUeFJRoG_R-q-YrpOHzh1ZzBuVNaJMlG2zTKEcI5yRxTxyEJrRXdUY2jvIAwuZ8JXYoHdmT6jV6TSJkw0A0l0fYLXVQ00POP2vf-eGW_uUNyg7TWN4a_6qVFTuw2Hh13l0iq1B_Jrw4vxRdCFy17zyLjOFpA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: SAT Study Guide 2020</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How to maximize your SAT practice test</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Know your weakness</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When doing your SAT practice test for any section, use a timer and have it count down to the allotted time on the real test:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>65 minutes for reading</li><li>35 minutes for writing</li><li>25 minutes for mathematics with no calculator</li><li>55 minutes for mathematics with a calculator</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If time runs out for that section and you\'re not done yet, continue working for as long as you need. For every new answer or answer that you change, write down ‘Extra Time\' for each question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\'re done, grade your test using the answer key and score chart with two scores:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The Real score you got under normal timing conditions</li><li>The Extra Time score—include the questions you answered or changed during Extra Time</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>By marking which questions you did under Extra Time, you can find out the score you will get if you were given all the time you needed. In this way, you can figure out where your weaknesses lie.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Understand your mistakes</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To greatly improve your SAT score, take the time to understand each mistake you made on your SAT practice test. Find out why you made it and what you will do to avoid it in the future. Here are common SAT mistakes that students make:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Content weakness</li><li>Time constraints&nbsp;</li><li>Question comprehension issue</li><li>Careless mistake&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>After finishing your SAT practice test, catalog all the questions you answer incorrectly so you can find the error patterns.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Preparing for the SAT can be challenging.

The reason is that the score is essential to maximize their chance of admission on the university application. Therefore, many students out there try their best to succeed either in terms of material readiness or mental preparation. Let\'s take a look at a few tips on how you can ace the SAT test below!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Plan an SAT Study Schedule</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though it may seem obvious, studying for the SAT will increase your score. Many students finish their coursework by taking a few practice exams. However, a schedule might help you stay on course and make sure you constantly study.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Selecting an SAT test date is the first step in creating your study schedule. You can plan regular study sessions once you know when the exam will be given. Plan to spend at least two to three hours every week studying. You want to avoid being exhausted before the test day and keep the subject fresh in your mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Use Quality Prep Materials</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The SAT study tools you choose can have an impact on both your score and how well-prepared you feel on test day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your first stop should be the College Board website. There, you may access practice questions, full-length sample exams, answer explanations, and advice in addition to downloading the free SAT Study Guide. A partner of the College Board, Khan Academy, also offers hundreds of official SAT practice questions and video explanations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Increase Your Reading Speed</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The ability to read questions accurately and rapidly is crucial on the SAT. You want to speed through the Reading section without missing any important details. You\'ll have more time to think about the answers if you read the questions and passages on the test more quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can improve your familiarity with the SAT question format and vocabulary by reading through and practicing sample SAT questions. You might also look at strategies for quickening your reading and comprehension. You may, for instance, practice word chunking or limit going back and rereading sentences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Come to Test Day Prepared</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can, get a good night\'s sleep and eat a healthy breakfast. Consider treating yourself to your preferred cup of coffee or tea to lift your spirits. Additionally, as the testing room might be either warm or chilly, it is better to wear layers of clothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick review of test-taking techniques or arithmetic concepts will help to jolt your memory. On the day of the test, though, try not to exhaust yourself by cramming in too much studying. Additionally, allow extra time to get to the exam venue in case of traffic or other delays.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Answer the Questions You Know First</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Going through the current section of the SAT exam and answering all the questions you are familiar with first is a common test-taking technique. You\'ll have more time to work through the questions you\'re less sure about if you can answer the ones you know quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to remember to return to a question later, mark it in your exam booklet if it takes you longer than a few minutes to grasp it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may notice that not everything is about the material or your study preparation. Your condition is also one of the main factors that will decide your end game. Therefore, you need to make sure to pace your study and balance it with rest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to have better preparation for the SAT?

As you would expect, the higher your SAT score, the greater the chance to get into your dream university. But is there a certain SAT score threshold that marks a ‘good\' score? Let\'s find it all here!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the SAT?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) is a three-hour test created for high school students and administered by the College Board. It is composed of three main sections—Math, Evidence-Based Reading, and Writing—and is used to measure a student\'s academic knowledge and skills to determine their preparedness for higher education.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Section</strong></td><td><strong>Sub-section</strong></td><td><strong>Total Testing Time</strong></td><td><strong>Number of Questions </strong><strong>	</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Evidence-Based Reading & Writing</td><td>Reading</td><td>65 minutes</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>Writing&nbsp;</td><td>35 minutes</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>Math</td><td>No Calculator</td><td>25 minutes</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Calculator&nbsp;</td><td>55 minutes&nbsp;</td><td>38</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>SAT Score Breakdown&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your SAT score, which ranges from 400 to 1600, is the sum of your two section scores: Math and Evidence-Based Reading and Writing (EBRW). Each section is scored between 200 and 800 in 10-point increments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all questions receive the same weight when scored as they have different levels of difficulty. The College Board converts your raw scores into scaled scores, which are then used to calculate percentile ranks. The percentile indicates how well you did compared to other test takers.

This is because it is a deciding factor if the university has a candidate with similar academic rigor. Therefore, it is important that you take the SAT exam seriously and prepare accordingly. Let\'s take a look at how you can prepare for your SAT exam.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Step 1: Research the SAT</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you start your preparation for the SAT, you need to get to know the ins and outs of the SAT. Get to know the exam syllabus, pattern, and question types thoroughly. Consider this the first step in your SAT preparation. You need to do thorough research on the SAT to make sure that you know what to expect in terms of the exam and its weight on your university application.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Step 2: Learn the exam format</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being familiar with the exam format can help you be more prepared on test day. Familiarize yourself with the format that the exams are going to have. It is important to know about the subjects and the format before you take the exam.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Step 3: Take practice tests</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By taking practice exams, you can get a sense of where you stand and how much additional study is necessary to acquire the results you want. You need to take a few practice tests before you get into the real deal. This is also an important step to find out what kind of questions you will encounter in the exam.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Step 4: Work on areas that you are lacking</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After you take practice tests, you will get an idea of the sections in which you are performing well and the sections in which you lack and need to practice well. You can do this by reviewing your previous answers with the answer sheets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Step 5:&nbsp; Plan a proper study schedule</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Making a suitable study schedule would be the next step. Dedicate enough time to your SAT preparation and start studying, depending on how much work you need to do. Remember that it is better to focus on quality over quantity. When you plan your study schedule, make sure you learn until you understand and do not jump to the next subject when things get hard. After all, you want a good overall score. Practice a lot if you want to ace the SAT; there is no other way to do it!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Step 6: Get help!</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need guidance with your SAT preparation, get it. There are many SAT coaching programs that offer thorough exam preparation. Mentors can help you pace your studies and optimize your preparation. Not only that, mentors can accompany your preparation so you don\'t need to prepare everything by yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, knowing the steps is not enough for you to succeed on your SAT exam. You need to maintain discipline and plan your studies so that you can get the best outcome. On the other hand, if you feel overwhelmed by the preparation, there are also mentors that can help you improve your SAT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need help preparing for SAT exams?

Without further ado, let\'s find out more about SAT!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is the SAT?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The SAT is a standardized test used by US colleges and universities to help them evaluate potential students by testing their critical thinking skills and their ability to analyze and solve problems. Its goal is to assess a student\'s ability and readiness for college courses in three academic areas—reading, writing, and math.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>SAT Score breakdown&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your SAT score, which ranges from 400 to 1600, is the sum of your two section scores: Math and Evidence-Based Reading and Writing (EBRW). Each section is scored between 200 and 800 in 10-point increments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all questions receive the same weight when scored as they have different levels of difficulty. The College Board converts your raw scores into scaled scores, which are then used to calculate percentile ranks. The percentile indicates how well you did compare to other test takers. For example, if you score in the 75th percentile, you did better than 75% of test takers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SAT scores follow a normal distribution.

Salah satu yang utama adalah untuk menjaga nama baik brand yang mereka punya. Kenapa hal ini penting? Karena berkomunikasi langsung melalui brand adalah salah satu cara paling efektif untuk berkomunikasi dengan konsumen. Tidak hanya itu saja lho! Ayo simak tugas public relation di bawah ini</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Mendapatkan Liputan Media</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dari sekian banyak tugas public relation, mendapatkan publikasi pada media yang mempunyai target audience yang sama merupakan salah satu tugas dari PR. Membangun hubungan membutuhkan waktu. Profesional PR diharapkan untuk membuat penawaran yang bijaksana dan didukung data, terlibat dengan reporter di media sosial, memelihara daftar media yang relevan, dan mengelola hubungan laik dengan reporter dan jurnalis. Pada saat yang sama, profesional PR juga terus memikirkan cara memaksimalkan jangkauan dan dampak media yang mereka bisa dapatkan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tugas Public Relation: <strong>Pemantauan & Analisis Media</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dalam lingkungan berbasis data saat ini, penting untuk memantau dan menganalisis konten apa pun yang muncul atau dipublikasikan. Menggunakan platform pemantauan media sangat penting bagi profesional PR saat ini yang ingin dapat dengan cepat menarik wawasan tentang apa yang berhasil atau apa yang sedang trending untuk mempermudah kerja mereka.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Komunikasi Perusahaan</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Seiring pertumbuhan perusahaan, komunikasi korporat menjadi lebih penting. Komunikator perusahaan secara teratur bekerja dengan pemangku kepentingan di seluruh organisasi untuk mengembangkan dan mendistribusikan informasi mengenai karyawan dan industri tempat mereka bernaung.. Menggunakan berbagai saluran seperti email, intranet, Slack, Basecamp, dan sebagainya, profesional PR memastikan bahwa pesan tidak hanya menjangkau audiens yang tepat tetapi juga menarik dan memicu tindakan yang diinginkan. Komunikasi korporat secara teratur melibatkan interaksi dengan para pemimpin senior dan departemen SDM.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tugas Public Relation: <strong>Brand Maintenance</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sangat penting untuk memiliki brand unik yang dibangun dan untuk menyampaikan nilai dan pernyataan misi yang dimiliki perusahaan. Menurut penelitian, loyalitas pada sebuah brand merupakan faktor utama dalam bagaimana dan mengapa konsumen membelanjakan uang mereka. Penciptaan, dokumentasi, dan distribusi pesan perusahaan yang menyeluruh merupakan bagian dari pekerjaan komunikasi perusahaan. Membangun brand yang kuat dengan pesan yang jelas tergantung pada pekerjaan ini. Saat perusahaan kamu berkembang, penyesuaian posisi dan pesan kemungkinan akan terjadi beberapa kali. Bukan hal yang aneh untuk mempekerjakan organisasi khusus berdasarkan proyek demi proyek untuk membantu reposisi atau riset pasar tertentu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Pelatihan PR</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pelatihan media sangat penting untuk jumlah karyawan yang jauh lebih besar dalam suatu organisasi karena jangkauan bentuk media saat ini dan perluasan publikasi. Semakin banyak eksekutif yang dilatih oleh para ahli PR. Siapapun yang akan berinteraksi atau berada di media membutuhkan pelatihan media. Pakar PR dapat memutuskan untuk melatih juru bicara sendiri atau menggunakan jasa konsultan atau agensi luar untuk melakukan pelatihan PR ini. Pedoman untuk berkomunikasi dengan media, termasuk media sosial, dapat dikembangkan oleh profesional PR.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Manajemen Krisis</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Di sepanjang berjalannya sebuah brand, ada yang pernah mengalami PR crisis. Hal ini terjadi karena ada beberapa masalah dengan produk, konsumen, atau keadaan lain yang akhirnya membuat sebuah brand terkenal masalah. Manajemen reputasi dan komunikasi krisis adalah sabuk pengaman yang harus selalu dipakai oleh sebuah brand. Sangat penting untuk memiliki rencana sebelum terjadi kesalahan di media karena siklus berita yang cepat hari ini. Salah satu contoh yang bisa dibilang blunder PR adalah saat salah satu brand memberikan somasi kepada salah satu konsumennya karena memberikan komentar terhadap produk mereka.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dari sekian banyak tugas public relation yang diemban, tetap saja semuanya akan berpusat dan berfokus pada nama baik sebuah brand. Nama baik dan reputasi sebuah brand akan berhubungan langsung dengan performa penjualan produk. Maka dari itu, bidang ini merupakan sebuah elemen yang paling penting untuk sebuah perusahaan lho.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tertarik untuk masuk ke jurusan public relation?

(14747, 'take-a-look-at-the-benefits-of-software-engineering-jobs', 7, 0, 'Take a Look at the Benefits of Software Engineering Jobs', '<p>The rise of technology has made almost every business go digital. You can see this from the many apps that you can find on the App Store or Play Store. With the high demand for jobs, you can also get many great benefits from securing a software engineering job. Let\'s take a look at some of them below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>High Demand</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, there is a tremendous demand for software engineers. Practically every industry needs its own type of software and engineers who have the capability of creating it following the required specifications. The opening for software engineers is growing and will continue to grow as the world becomes more digital and is run online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone now uses technology extensively, and its influence is only growing. Technology is now a necessity for many new businesses, and this dependency is growing rapidly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part is that software engineers are important in all sectors of the economy and you can choose the sector in which you want to work. Numerous industries, including those in healthcare, technology, green energy, finance, the military, automobile manufacturing, and remote sensing, are available for you to choose from.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Career Options</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many more alternatives open to you if software engineering is your chosen field of study or employment. This is one of the most useful benefits of software engineering. There are a lot of businesses trying to develop apps that can accommodate their customers. You can choose whether you want to work as a developer for a big corporation or independently. You can choose a lifestyle and work environment based on your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, you have a wide range of industry options. You can create video games or healthcare software, for instance. You can simply transition to a different field using these same talents if you feel like altering your working environment or the type of software you\'re building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, there is an opportunity for more development in this area. You can become a senior programmer in this industry after starting as a beginner. The majority of programmers can advance into managerial jobs, where they simply oversee the development process rather than writing the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Remote Work</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the pandemic, working from home has become more and more common. People are forced to stay at home to keep everyone and themselves safe. As a practitioner in software engineering, being able to work from home is absolutely necessary. Developers can typically work from home because practically all of their work is done on a computer. But a developer can work from other places too, as long as they can interact well with their team. If you are the type of person who prefers to do their work at home, software engineering might be an excellent career choice because of its flexibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Working Collaboratively or Independently</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may work alone or in a team when working as a software engineer. The total software development project is typically cut into smaller components, with developers taking on their specialized jobs. This implies that developers can work independently for a while before contacting their team to talk about how their contribution fits into the project. Whether you prefer working alone or with others, being a software engineer will allow you to do both.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Scope in the Future</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI, enterprise solutions, and robots with custom languages for data processing, operation, statistical analysis, functioning, analytical analysis, and cyber security take part in software engineering\'s future.

This process requires you to put all of your attention and time into it . This is because there are a lot of things that you need to do and every detail needs to be perfect. Not only do you need to make sure that every requirement is fulfilled, but you also need to keep your progress on track with the application deadline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are the application deadlines for NUS application:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Qualification Type</strong></td><td><strong>AY2023 Application Closing Dates</strong></td><td><strong>Estimated Application Outcome by:</strong></td><td><strong>Appeal Window</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Indonesian Ujian Nasional (UN)<br><br>Vietnam National High School Graduation Examination<br><br>Unified Examination Certificate (UEC)</td><td>31 January 2023, Tuesday</td><td>Mid-May</td><td>May 2022</td></tr><tr><td>All other qualifications</td><td>3 March 2023, Friday</td><td>Mid-May to end July</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After knowing the application deadline, the next step is to know the application process for international students.

One of the most common reasons for startup failure is the inability to raise new capital. To succeed against the odds, entrepreneurs require an understanding of company ownership, valuation methods, and the different forms of investment methods. This is where entrepreneurial finance comes in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is Entrepreneurial Finance?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While corporate <a href=\"https://all-inedu.com/finance-the-everlasting-field-with-great-potential/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"finance (opens in a new tab)\">finance</a> focuses on already-existing organizations and the challenges they face, entrepreneurial finance is the study of value and resource allocation. It is the process of acquiring capital and making financial decisions for a new venture or startup, and it addresses the owner\'s challenge on several financial components. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This includes how much money the business should raise, which sources of funding are viable, and how they should arrange funding contracts and exit decisions. By doing so, the business can see whether it can become financially sustainable or not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When starting a company, entrepreneurs need to be flexible and fast-moving in order to acquire the finance needed for scaling operations, hiring employees, and turning their vision into a reality. This involves approaching investors and seeking loans. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are several sources of capital financing for firms, each of which uses a different valuation method and investment approach:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. <strong>Venture capital&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Venture capital (VC) is a form of private equity commonly used to fund fast-growing start-ups and small organizations with the intention of selling their shares in the middle stage. They take on high risks and expect high returns when investing. The funds generally come from well-off investors, investment banks, and other forms of financial institutions. Moreover, venture capitalists don\'t always provide investment in the form of financial funding; it can also come in the form of managerial or technological expertise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. <strong>Crowdfunding</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Crowdfunding is the use of small amounts of capital from a large number of individuals to finance a new business venture. Furthermore, it uses social media and crowdfunding websites to connect investors and entrepreneurs. Moreover, there are four main types of crowdfunding: equity crowdfunding, reward-based crowdfunding, donation-based crowdfunding, and debt-securities crowdfunding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. <strong>Financial Bootstrapping</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bootstrapping is when an entrepreneur starts and builds a company from personal finances or the operating revenues of the new company. In contrast with using venture capital, bootstrapping can be beneficial because the entrepreneur has complete control over all decisions. On the negative side, bootstrapping could expose the business owner to financial risk and might not provide enough funding for the company to grow successfully at a reasonable rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What financial skills does an entrepreneur need?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to successfully grow a business, entrepreneurs need to possess a strong financial skill set in order to persuade investors to provide funding and turn their vision into a reality. To develop these skills, they can start by taking classes or courses such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Financial Literacy</li><li>Financial Modeling</li><li>Sources of Funding</li><li>Company Valuation and Exit Planning</li><li>Negotiation of Terms</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you\'ve gained an insight into entrepreneurial finance, are you interested in gaining an in-depth understanding of it?

Stanford does not take just anyone into their graduate school, so you need to know the main criteria to optimize your chances of getting an acceptance letter to Stanford MBA.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is Stanford MBA?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stanford MBA Curriculum is a two-year, full-time general management program that aids in the development of your vision and your ability to carry it out. To get an MBA from Stanford, first, you must apply to the Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford GSB is one of the best schools out there if you are aiming to be a master of business. At Stanford GSB, you\'ll be surrounded by intelligent, ambitious individuals from all over the world who want to change it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your cohort will challenge you in ways that would never be possible when working alone. Students at Stanford can grow, study and lead alongside one another in an atmosphere that is unmatched by any other.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What are the Criteria for Stanford MBA?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stanford MBA\'s goal is to create moral, perceptive, and creative leaders. Stanford looks for students who will participate in their classes and bring positive influence both on and off campus. The Stanford application asks questions about <strong>how you think</strong>, <strong>how you lead</strong>, and <strong>how you see the world.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How You Think</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your application will not only be evaluated based on your GPA and test results. While Stanford does look at these to determine how prepared you are for the academic program, they go much beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please consider the times you have taken the initiative to learn new things, to tackle difficult challenges, or to generate new insights as you finish your application. What have you found out? How did you spread your knowledge? Why is it important to you and other people? To better understand how you might contribute to the Stanford learning community both inside and outside of the classroom, they would like to hear about these experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How You Lead</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The admissions committee wants to know about your past accomplishments, specifically how you improved the organizations and communities in which you have been active in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At all levels and in all parts of an organization, leaders help people achieve a common objective. You do not need to occupy a specific function nor reach a certain level or title to display leadership. Stanford is looking for instances in which you have shown initiative, perseverance in the face of difficulties, involvement of others in your endeavors, and support from people around you, whether it was at your university, in a professional capacity, or perhaps during an extracurricular activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How You See the World</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your goals, identity, and values will influence your journey and broaden your classmates\' viewpoints. In your essays, you will have the chance to talk about the things that are most important to you and your goals. The admissions officers are curious about how your background has influenced both your present career and your future aspirations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stanford\'s collaborative teaching process makes use of the diversity of students\' backgrounds to bring a range of ideas and approaches to real-world problems. Due to this, Stanford looks to admit candidates who bring a variety of viewpoints and experiences to the MBA class.
